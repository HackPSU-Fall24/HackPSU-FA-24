In their course of study, students study the role and function of public relations in building cooperative mutually beneficial relations between organizations and their constituent publics through understanding, credibility, and trust.\n \nStudents complete a core set of courses that includes news writing, introduction to public relations, public relations methods, mass communication research, and public relations problems (campaigns).\n \nBecause of the critical importance of journalistic writing skills and an understanding of news media ethics, public relations majors are encouraged to take additional journalism courses to fulfill their communication electives.\n \nAdvertising and public relations students are encouraged to choose a minor from outside the Bellisario College of Communications. The majority of majors select minors in business, English, sociology, psychology, political science, information systems and statistical analysis, world language, and speech communication.\n\n\nWhat is Advertising and Public Relations?\n\n\nIn general, advertising and public relations are similar because the goal is sharing a message with an audience. At its simplest, advertising typically relies on paid messages to sell a product and public relations typically uses unpaid channels to sell an idea. Students who major in advertising/public relations at Penn State have a wealth of opportunities thanks to a degree that allows them to build on many of the same core skills before focusing on the advertising or public relations track. In each area, students can combine classroom instruction with hands-on work through partnerships or real-life client projects. Advertising students learn the art of persuasive storytelling via multiple mediums and how advertising affects mass media and how consumers are influenced by ads. Public relations students gain an understanding of brand building, research, and strategic planning to position a message to make an impact through various channels.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou're creative, curious and like sharing ideas and information with others.\n\n\nYou like to write and talk, or if you\u2019re comfortable with social media, advertising/public relations will play to your strengths.\n\n\n\n\nDesign, digital storytelling, and video skills are also valuable in the field as professionals regularly utilize a variety of tools to do their jobs. In addition, the field thrives on collaboration but also allows room for self-directed workers to succeed.\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT ADVERTISING/PUBLIC RELATIONS",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nAnthropology is a holistic scientific discipline having links to the humanities. Anthropologists document, describe, and explain the physical and cultural differences of societies, both past and present. Anthropology sees the individual as part of a larger social order that both impinges upon and is molded by those who belong to it. Anthropology investigates how cultures interact and relate within specific economic, political, and ecological frameworks over time.\n \nThe Bachelor of Arts major focuses on the biological and cultural variations of human populations through archaeology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology. In addition to class work, students receive practical training in laboratory and field work.\n\n\nWhat is Anthropology?\n\n\nAnthropology is the study of human diversity \u2013 our biology, behavior, cultural complexity, and evolution.\u00a0 Anthropologists study living people across cultures and populations; past people through the fossil, archaeological, and historical records; as well as living and extinct nonhuman primates. Anthropologists document, describe, and seek to understand biological and cultural variation in humans both past and present as a way to understand and explain the human condition. The field is divided into several integrated areas of study. Archaeology focuses on past societies, both ancient and historic, in order to understand and explain culture change over time. Biological Anthropology describes and explains human biological variation today and in the past. Human Ecology or Cultural Anthropology studies contemporary societies and cultures and their interactions with the environment.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in human cultural and biological variation and you want to understand human behavior and biology.\n\n\nYou find human diversity fascinating and want to explore and understand the human condition.\n\n\nYou want to study important questions such as \u2018what makes us human?\u2019 and \u2018what is the origin and importance of human diversity?\u2019\n\n\nYou want to pursue a career in anthropological research, museum curation, education, health professions, law, non-governmental organizations, or international relations.",

It's museum studies, historiography, iconography, art criticism, connoisseurship, and research. It's studying aesthetics, and the context, form, and social significance of art throughout time and place. Art history relates visual images back to questions of religion, politics, society, gender, economics, philosophy, and culture.\n\n\nYou Might Like this Program If...\n\n\n\n\nArt, architecture, and/or other visual material makes your mind light up with questions such as \"Who?

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe program in Civil and Environmental Engineering is designed to provide the basic undergraduate education required for private practice and public service in civil engineering and/or continue formal education. Emphasis is placed on the fundamentals of civil engineering principles and design techniques. Students utilize basic engineering science concepts in several of the different specialty areas (e.g., construction/management, environmental, materials/pavement design/geotechnical, structures, transportation, and water resources). Finally the students are able to choose an area of specialization for professional practice or graduate studies.\n \nThe program is broadened by courses in communication, arts, humanities, social and behavioral sciences, as well as other engineering disciplines. Students gain experience in working as members of a team and using interdisciplinary approaches to solve problems. These experiences, as well as those related to engineering principles and design, are provided through exercises in the classroom, laboratory, and field. The program culmination is a capstone design course wherein the students' knowledge and skills are applied to actual engineering problems.\n\n\nWhat is Civil Engineering?\n\n\nCivil engineering is one of the oldest and most socially-relevant engineering disciplines. Grounded in mathematics and science, civil engineers make a lasting impact as they plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain the everyday, yet critical, infrastructure systems needed in our daily lives. In this challenging and diverse field, civil engineers also find solutions for critical environmental issues, including slowing the progress and mitigating the effects of climate change, eliminating the causes and treating the effects of environmental pollutants, and providing access to clean water. In recent years, the rapid application of new technologies has fostered the development of autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, smart structures, advanced materials, and new forms of renewable energy.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to design and build large-scale projects that last a long time.\n\n\nYou care about the quality of the water that comes out of the faucet.\n\n\nYou are interested in the operations and safety of future transportation systems.\n\n\nYou try to find sustainable solutions for every challenge, big or small.\n\n\nYou would like to use your technical skills in an exciting, people-serving profession.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe Corporate Innovation and Entrepreneurship major prepares students for challenges in the development of emerging products and new markets for demanding consumers. The ability to adapt to a rapidly changing social and business environment can yield great rewards and returns, but it requires innovative, multifunctional individuals able to adapt to and develop new technologies, innovations and businesses amid a wider environment of change, uncertainty and ambiguity. The major is conceived for students interested in starting and managing new businesses or innovating within existing business with the intent of growing the economy and providing jobs for a diverse workforce. The major focuses on developing problem solving and creative thinking skills, along with the ability to recognize opportunities, spot trends, and develop a plan to capitalize on these ideas. Emerging entrepreneurs and innovative managers of small to large businesses must be competent in various mediums of communication, have good negotiation skills, can lead with ethics and integrity, and are grounded in business aspects of planning, capital investing, goal setting, and decision making.\n\n\nWhat is Corporate Innovation and Entrepreneurship?\n\n\nMost people understand the concept of entrepreneurship \u2013 starting and running a new venture or small business. Corporate innovation, however, may not be as clear. The corporate innovation component of the CIENT major focuses on opportunities within the consulting industry as well as new product development and innovation within an existing company. The cornerstone of corporate innovation is the ability to identify opportunities and use corporate resources to implement change. An example can be a well-known chocolate company that initiated printing pictures on small pieces of candy which then opened up a whole new market segment for the company. Think creative ways to breathe life into existing product lines, or taking advantage of technology to lead a division into new business offerings or new business segments. CIENT embraces the mindset to continually look for new opportunities within an entrepreneurial context and a corporate environment.\u00a0\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT CORPORATE INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP",

The program recognizes students must understand the relationship between tradition and individual talent, and provides a required sequence of literature courses designed to give students an overview of the historical literary traditions, especially modern and contemporary prose and poetry. It also provides options for sequences of writing workshops, requires a course in creative writing theory, and requires a course that fosters professional development and features live reading by visiting authors. The program culminates in a capstone experience, the senior thesis, a collection of poetry or prose of publishable quality that includes a critical preface demonstrating the students' ability to analyze and contextually their own writing.\n\n\nWhat is Creative Writing?\n\n\nCreative writing is a liberal arts discipline concerned with the practice of literary art, the life of the imagination, and the capacities of language.

Digital Arts and Media Design approaches design through the lens of the visual arts, as a critical, creative, and experimental studio-based practice. The major prepares students to become leaders in digital media fields where their commanding knowledge of emerging technologies allows them to contribute and innovate in creative media design careers.\n \nStudents\u2019 progress through a series of core courses in which they develop research, design, and computational skills to enhance their capacity for critical thinking. In addition to these core experiences, students hone creative thinking capabilities in a range of studio-based digital art and design courses. In the final year of study, students work rigorously on a senior thesis project based on topics of personal interests and areas of intensive study in the digital arts. A purpose of the thesis is to prepare students to meet the varying challenges they will face as digital art and design professionals.\n \nStudents may choose from one of three primary tracks in the program:\n \n \nDigital Art and Digital Design Emphasis: In this track students create individualized 2d-3d digital arts and design learning paths that may include UX/UI design (user experience/user interface), visual concept art and design, 3d modeling and digital fabrication, 2d-3d digital imaging and computer graphics, as well as the most recent emerging forms of digital art and design.\n \nInteractive Media Emphasis: In this track students create individualized learning paths for interactive media design. Students learn computational skills as visual thinkers, designing increasingly complex interactive experiences individually and in teams. Students take courses in game art, game design, physical computing, mobile and web design, virtual worlds, interactive media design, data visualization and cultural analytics.\n \nTime Based Media Emphasis: In this track students create individualized learning paths for 2d and 3d time based digital arts and media design including motion graphics, animation, computer graphics and pre-visualization as well as video compositing.\n \n\n\nWhat is Digital Arts and Media Design?\n\n\nDigital Arts and Media Design uses digital arts technologies in studio-lab settings to challenge young artists and designers to expand their ideas as they explore new languages of visual expression and communication. Following familiar studio ways of thinking and making traditionally associated with practices such as mixing pigments in painting, or shaping clay in ceramics, digital artists manipulate computer software through coding to expand the potential for creating new forms of image making. In an electronic environment, the single work of art may be replaced by multiple copies that are cloned and reworked using a range of image-making systems. Digital artworks may be exhibited in a variety of forms, such as digital prints, computer printouts, or other hard copy formats of any scale where each translation offers different interpretations. Digital art may also be encountered through networks, interactive games, simulations, or as immersive environments that require active participation by a viewer.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYour curiosity and creativity is stimulated by thinking visually in computer languages and graphic communication, and you are inspired by the thought that a digital device is a flexible and adaptive \u2018studio\u2019 space where you come up with your best ideas. You will plan and apply your creative design skills in a climate of invention and collaboration in interdisciplinary projects that explore changing visual technologies in art and design.",

Reflectivity relates to consciously analyzing course content and one's own learning for the purpose of deeper understanding and self-improvement.

Program requirements include interdisciplinary courses in environmental studies and a broad array of courses in biology, geology, chemistry, physics, geography, economics, political science, English, history, and philosophy. By selecting appropriate electives to supplement the \"additional courses\" requirement of the major, students may develop an emphasis in either a specific field (i.e., biology) or in a general area of study (natural science, social science, and humanities).

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nIt is an interdisciplinary program with two options. One option is Environmental Systems Engineering and it is concerned with the impact of industrial activities on the environment and the choice of cost-effective remediation strategies. The other option is Environmental Health and Safety Engineering and it is concerned with safe and healthful design of industrial systems such that workers are protected from potentially high-risk exposures associated with today's industries. The program is unique as it is designed to address critical environmental, safety and health problems of the basic industries such as those involved in the extraction, conversion, and utilization of energy and mineral resources. The courses are sequenced so that students acquire an appropriate blend of theory, applications, and design and are equipped with the fundamentals necessary to maintain lifelong professional growth. Graduates are prepared to enter both the private and public sectors as environmental systems engineers or health and safety engineers or to pursue further education at the graduate level.\n \nDuring the first two years, the program shares many common features with other more traditional engineering disciplines. Students then take a series of special courses that introduce engineering concepts in the extractive and process industries. Process engineering and a variety of solid-solid, solid-fluid, and fluid-fluid separations play a major and often dominant role in the prevention and/or remediation of environmental damage or the prevention of health and safety hazards resulting from industrial activity. Students then specialize in the particular problems associated with air, land, or water; environmental health and safety engineering; or select a hybrid program. Specialization is accomplished through a combination of additional designated courses and selection from an extensive list of relevant elective courses. The curriculum is structured so as to integrate design concepts into the various subject areas covered in the program.\n \nThe human, societal, economic, ethical, and regulatory aspects of the industrial impact on the environment and on the workers themselves are addressed through a combination of specific courses and components of other more general courses. This aspect of the program is designed to provide students with a deeper understanding, both of the impact of environmental degradation on society and of the effects on industrial activity of society's demands for protection of workers and the environment. The program culminates with the capstone design course, which is an integrated, problem-based, multi-faceted project in which students, working in a team setting, utilize fundamental concepts to design an environmental remediation system or an environmental health and safety protection system (or incorporate these design requirements into other associated designs).\n\n\nWhat is Environmental Systems Engineering?\n\n\nProtecting the health of workers and the environment, often during challenging projects, is the job of an environmental systems engineer. They understand, demonstrate, and apply systems engineering principles to environmental issues related to industrial activities and to the extraction of energy and mineral resources. These engineers work closely with project leaders, utilizing process systems engineering and environmental systems approaches, to evaluate and address the environmental impact of projects. Often these engineers work in the government sector and offer expertise in big-picture projects facing cities, regions, nations, and the globe.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to minimize the environmental impact of industrial activities and protect the health of workers.\n\n\nYou have strong math, science, and engineering skills and want to apply that to improving worker and environmental safety.",

Students completing this program will have excellent written, oral, and visual communication/presentation skills and will understand the appropriate application, use of analytical tools, and interpretation of results of analyses. The program begins with courses that provide students with the fundamental communication, mathematical and statistical skills needed to analyze data and communicate the results of the analysis. Three of four data analysis courses covering descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics will be co-taught by a data analytics and an English faculty member to help students learn analytical techniques while practicing essential visualization, oral, and written communication skills. In these courses, students will use real data sets supplied by external partners including businesses or industries. In their second year, students will choose a knowledge domain (e.g., higher education administration, finance, SMART manufacturing, genomics) in which to gain a deeper understanding of domain-specific applications of data analysis. The program will culminate in a two-semester capstone course in which students apply all skills learned in their analytics and domain-specific courses to data provided by an external stakeholder (business, industry, not-for-profit organization, scientific researcher) to address a question posed by that stakeholder.\n\n\nWhat is Functional Data Analytics?\n\n\nThe world runs on data, and the people who best understand it\u2014and who can explain it\u2014are essential to any organization.

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nGeobiology is the interdisciplinary study of the Earth and its biosphere. It embraces the history of life and its interactions with the Earth over geologic time; it also includes study of interactions between living organisms and physical and chemical processes in the modern environment on Earth, and possibly elsewhere in the universe. Thus, geobiology encompasses the fields of paleobiology and paleontology, biogeochemistry, geomicrobiology, and astrobiology. The degree program provides students with a strong background in general science and especially in geosciences and biology, with core selections from both disciplines. Students gain practical field experience in the study of the physical environment and ecological properties. The senior thesis provides students with hands-on research experience, as well as an emphasis on data synthesis and the written expression of scientific observations and ideas. Students will be well prepared for advanced studies in this emerging discipline, and for careers in the environmental sciences. Geobiology is critical to the study of environmental quality, global change, and environmental-human health interactions, all of which have profound importance in legal, economic, and policy arenas.\n\n\nWhat is Geobiology?\n\n\nGeobiology is the study of the interactions that occur between the biosphere (living organisms and their products) and the geosphere (solid part of the Earth). Geobiologists apply the principles and tools of biology to study the Earth and construct a picture of life through time. Geobiologists search for clues of how changes to the Earth in the past, such as periods of increased carbon dioxide or decreased temperature, have affected life on Earth and vice versa. By studying key aspects of the environment, geobiologists seek an understanding of how stressors affect entire populations, evolution, and extinctions. The study can involve field work such as collecting fossils or organic matter, or it can involve laboratory work using cutting-edge analytical instrumentation. By building a more detailed picture of how environmental changes affect life, geobiologists can help understand how predicted future environmental changes might impact life on Earth.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to understand the complexity of environmental factors that led to the origin and evolution of life on Earth and contributed to past mass extinctions.\n\n\nYou like to do field work outdoors, such as searching for fossils.\n\n\nYou are analytical and like to piece together clues to paint a picture of past life.\n\n\nYou like thinking about the big picture of evolution within Earth's geologic constraints.",

Combining geography with other areas of study allows students to choose from a broad range of topics in order to suit their individual interests. Undergraduate degrees in geography are offered in the Bachelor of Science (BS) and in the Bachelor of Arts (BA). Both programs offer an integrated course of study in which students learn fundamental concepts in physical and human geography while developing methodological proficiency in qualitative analysis, spatial analysis, and/or geospatial technologies.\n \nThe Bachelor of Arts (BA) major is a broader liberal-arts based program that incorporates world language study and courses outside the major in combination with core and elective geography courses. The BA Geography major is especially appropriate for students seeking a deeper understanding of the human experience and human-environment interactions, planning to combine their degree with concurrent majors and minors, or intending to pursue postgraduate work in geography or related disciplines.\n \nIn both the B.A. and B.S., students can customize and specialize their programs through the completion of undergraduate certificates. The Geography major can provide preparation for a career in business, industry, or government. Geographers with bachelor's degrees are currently being placed in federal, state, and local administrative and planning agencies and in private firms that specialize in planning and development or in environmental, socioeconomic, or location analysis.\n\n\nWhat is Geography?\n\n\nWhat do Amnesty International, Boeing, National Geographic, and Esri have in common? Penn State geographers are there, hard at work every day. Our students and alumni are behind the maps you use daily, as well as the policies that shape our cities, and the analysis that sustains our environment. Geographers help shape the future design of cities and infrastructure. Geographers assess impacts of rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and tropical storms, as well as study impacts of wild fires or manage wetlands. Geographers analyze new markets and locations for businesses. Geographers use cutting-edge satellite data to defend human rights by detecting large-scale abuses. Geographers also work directly with local people on social justice issues such as health and migration.

Combining geography with other areas of study allows students to choose from a broad range of topics in order to suit their individual interests. Undergraduate degrees in geography are offered in the Bachelor of Science (BS) and in the Bachelor of Arts (BA). Both programs offer an integrated course of study in which students learn fundamental concepts in physical and human geography while developing methodological proficiency in qualitative analysis, spatial analysis, and/or geospatial technologies.\n \nIn contrast to the broader liberal arts-oriented B.A., the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) major is a more disciplinary-focused program, emphasizing technical skills and preparation across the human/physical spectrum of geography. It includes rigorous training in the use of geographic tools and technologies as well as core and advanced courses on the ways people use environmental resources and how they arrange themselves and their economic, social, and political activities on the Earth's surface.\n \nIn both the B.S. and B.A., students can customize and specialize their programs through the completion of undergraduate certificates. The Geography major can provide preparation for a career in business, industry, or government. Geographers with bachelor's degrees are currently being placed in federal, state, and local administrative and planning agencies and in private firms that specialize in planning and development or in environmental, socioeconomic, or location analysis.\n\n\nWhat is Geography?\n\n\nThe Department of Geography in Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences offers a strong mix of human, physical, and methodological components that comprise the core of the geography major.

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary B.A. degree in Global and International Studies is intended to prepare students for lives and careers in a world that is increasingly interdependent. It reflects a \u201cOne World\u201d concept that emphasizes the importance of global perspectives, international communication, and study or working experience abroad. The major combines the expertise of multiple disciplines, including the Social Sciences and the Humanities, to suggest a variety of methods for understanding the dynamic issues facing human beings across the globe. The structure of the major also recognizes the fact that the vast majority of the world's people live in regions other than the European and North American spheres, and that a knowledge of non-Anglophone cultures is an important form of preparation for global citizenship.\n \nThe major develops transnational and trans-regional literacy, drawing on coursework both in the Humanities and the Social Sciences to focus on questions of globalization, ethical imagination, and ways to engage peoples and cultures in local terms. Students learn to situate global trends, both macro and micro in nature, in relation to other historical processes. Most courses for the GLIS major will demonstrate a global or regional (rather than national) perspective and address a central topic in one of five designated Pathways.\n \nHuman Rights\n \nThis Pathway examines the history, development, enforcement, and violations of concepts of the basic rights of mankind. Whether through questions of torture, freedom of conscience, trafficking of women and children, agreements about prisoners of war, human rights constantly need redefining and rethinking if they are to be broad enough to cover everyone on our planet and specific enough to have a real effect on human behavior.\n \nCulture and Identity\n \nGlobal economic, political, and cultural processes are bound up with complex questions of culture and identity at the individual, familial, and community levels. Examining how differences in language, ideology, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation among others impact our sense of self and other, this Pathway considers:\n \n \nfoundational expressions of social and cultural values;\n \nthe formation and contestation of identity over time;\n \nthe impacts of modernization on individual, family, and community identity;\n \ngenetic manipulation and modification; and\n \nquestions of colonization and colonialism on political and cultural structures.\n \n \nGlobal Conflict\n \nThis Pathway examines war, peace, and security on a global and historical scale to reveal the contingent decisions, random accidents, and devious schemes which continue to be at the root of violence around the world. This Pathway studies conflicts great and small, from tribal warfare to national and international wars, revolutions, acts of terrorism, and so on. It also considers successful and unsuccessful efforts to halt conflict, and how and why approaches to and experiences with peace can affect conflict situations.\n \nWealth and Inequality\n \nThis Pathway considers global distribution of people, goods, and money, both in the contemporary world and in deep historical time, examining feudalism, trade, imperialism, nationalism, and the socioeconomic impacts of globalization. Some of the themes on which it focuses include:\n \n \nmotivations for and experiences of such human movement as migration, exploration, travel, slavery, diaspora, asylum, and exile;\n \ndemographic change;\n \npoverty, wealth, and economic inequality; and\n \npolitical, social, and cultural incentives for and restrictions on circulation (censorship, translation, free trade, prize culture, protectionism, access, privilege, bias).\n \n \nHealth and Environment\n \nThis Pathway considers the direct impact of global issues on the life on our planet. As intercontinental travel makes nearly every epidemic already global today, the more and more the health of individuals is directly connected to the health of the globe.

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary B.S. degree in Global and International Studies is intended to prepare students for lives and careers in a world that is increasingly interdependent. It reflects a \u201cOne World\u201d concept that emphasizes the importance of global perspectives, international communication, and study or working experience abroad. The major combines the expertise of multiple disciplines, including the Social Sciences and the Humanities, to suggest a variety of methods for understanding the dynamic issues facing human beings across the globe. The structure of the major also recognizes the fact that the vast majority of the world's people live in regions other than the European and North American spheres, and that a knowledge of non-Anglophone cultures is an important form of preparation for global citizenship.\n \nThe major develops transnational and trans-regional literacy, drawing on coursework both in the Humanities and the Social Sciences to focus on questions of globalization, ethical imagination, and ways to engage peoples and cultures in local terms. Students learn to situate global trends, both macro and micro in nature, in relation to other historical processes. Most courses for the GLIS major will demonstrate a global or regional (rather than national) perspective and address a central topic in one of five designated Pathways.\n \nHuman Rights\n \nThis Pathway examines the history, development, enforcement, and violations of concepts of the basic rights of mankind. Whether through questions of torture, freedom of conscience, trafficking of women and children, agreements about prisoners of war, human rights constantly need redefining and rethinking if they are to be broad enough to cover everyone on our planet and specific enough to have a real effect on human behavior.\n \nCulture and Identity\n \nGlobal economic, political, and cultural processes are bound up with complex questions of culture and identity at the individual, familial, and community levels. Examining how differences in language, ideology, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation among others impact our sense of self and other, this Pathway considers:\n \n \nfoundational expressions of social and cultural values;\n \nthe formation and contestation of identity over time;\n \nthe impacts of modernization on individual, family, and community identity;\n \ngenetic manipulation and modification; and\n \nquestions of colonization and colonialism on political and cultural structures.\n \n \nGlobal Conflict\n \nThis Pathway examines war, peace, and security on a global and historical scale to reveal the contingent decisions, random accidents, and devious schemes which continue to be at the root of violence around the world. This Pathway studies conflicts great and small, from tribal warfare to national and international wars, revolutions, acts of terrorism, and so on. It also considers successful and unsuccessful efforts to halt conflict, and how and why approaches to and experiences with peace can affect conflict situations.\n \nWealth and Inequality\n \nThis Pathway considers global distribution of people, goods, and money, both in the contemporary world and in deep historical time, examining feudalism, trade, imperialism, nationalism, and the socioeconomic impacts of globalization. Some of the themes on which it focuses include:\n \n \nmotivations for and experiences of such human movement as migration, exploration, travel, slavery, diaspora, asylum, and exile;\n \ndemographic change;\n \npoverty, wealth, and economic inequality; and\n \npolitical, social, and cultural incentives for and restrictions on circulation (censorship, translation, free trade, prize culture, protectionism, access, privilege, bias).\n \n \nHealth and Environment\n \nThis Pathway considers the direct impact of global issues on the life on our planet. As intercontinental travel makes nearly every epidemic already global today, the more and more the health of individuals is directly connected to the health of the globe. Growing populations, aging demographics, increasing pollution, and decreasing food resources present new challenges for global human health. Similarly the global cycles of climate change and crisis force us to reconsider both natural processes and anthropogenic influences, examining the philosophy and history of human's place in nature. Some of the themes on which this Pathway focuses include:\n \n \nthe relationship between local resources and global geopolitics;\n \ncultural, economic, and social effects of global climate change;\n \npollution and conservation;\n \nenvironmental movements; and\n \nevolution and extinction.\n \n \nAlternatively, students with a GPA above 3.5 may work with advisers and faculty to create a personalized Pathway that reflects their interests.\n \nThe B.S. degree requires six credits in quantitative competencies appropriate to the social sciences. The B.S. degree may include a significant engaged scholarship experience (such as undertaking an internship, job, volunteer position, or period of study) located either abroad or in a majority non-English-speaking part of the United States.\n\n\nWhat is Global and International Studies?\n\n\nThe Global and International Studies (GLIS) Program is devoted to understanding human cultures and societies as bounded by \u201cOne World\u201d.

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThis major would allow students to receive a BA degree in Linguistics. Linguistics, which is the study of language as a structural, cognitive, historical, and cultural phenomenon, intersects with many different academic disciplines and career paths. Linguists study how people acquire their knowledge of a language (or multiple languages), how this knowledge interacts with other cognitive processes, and how best to model this knowledge. They study how to represent the structure of the various aspects of language (such as sounds or meaning), how to account for different linguistic patterns theoretically, and how the different components of language interact with each other. Since every language is spoken across multiple communities of practice, linguists also study variation in language based on region, ethnicity, gender, or any number of other social factors. In order to learn about as many of the world's 7000 languages as possible, many linguists do fieldwork. This means that they work with speakers of little-studied languages to discover grammatical patterns and/or to document the language. Other linguists search databases (or corpora) of spoken and written language to find patterns there. Yet others run carefully-designed experiments with children and adults in schools, in the field, and in university labs. Linguistics is the scientific study of language in all its complexity.\n\n\nWhat is Linguistics?\n\n\nLinguistics is the scientific study of language: how it is structured, how it is acquired, how it is used to convey information, and how it changes over time. While many linguists do speak more than one language--or at least know how to approach the study of other languages--linguistics is much more than this. Through courses and a wide variety of research opportunities, our students explore how languages are structured (sentence structure, sound patterns, meaning and more), and how those structures are processed by the human brain. Since language is integral to all societies, linguists are interested in how language affects culture, and how social factors (place of birth, social class, ethnicity, gender, age, etc.) impact language use. We approach language from a global perspective, investigating commonalities and differences across languages in order to increase our understanding of what makes human communication unique.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou enjoy studying languages, particularly finding and applying linguistic patterns.\n\n\nYou are interested in communication, and learning more about the function of language(s) in society.\n\n\nYou like to think about how the human brain functions, and want to know more about language and cognition.\n\n\nYou like logic, computer programming, and/or abstract puzzles.",

Mechanical engineers create things that help improve the health, happiness and safety of our everyday lives such as biomedical devices, aircraft and cars, and ways to store renewable energies. Mechanical engineering is divided into two broad areas: mechanical systems and thermal systems. Mechanical systems include the design of mechanisms and the analysis of the strength and wear of materials. Thermal systems include methods of energy conversions, heat transfer and fluid flow.\n\n\nWhat is Mechanical Engineering?\n\n\nMechanical engineering is the largest and broadest engineering discipline. It uses a combination of physics, chemistry, mathematics, and materials science to study mechanical, fluid, and thermal systems. Mechanical engineers are problem solvers: They use their foundational knowledge to apply scientific and engineering methods to the design, construction, and testing of products and components to ensure that they are safe, reliable, and cost effective. Mechanical engineering differs from mechanical engineering technology in that it emphasizes the math and science behind the theoretical development of engineering analysis and design process principles rather than the application of these principles. Mechanical engineers design everything from athletic equipment, medical devices, theme park rides, and personal computers to engines and power plants.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou think outside the box to develop solutions to everyday problems.

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nMeteorology and atmospheric science is a rigorous scientific discipline devoted to the attainment of an increased understanding of the atmosphere and the development of methods for applying that knowledge to practical problems. Although this field is usually associated with weather prediction, it also has significance in environmental, energy, agricultural, oceanic, and hydrological sciences. For students wishing to pursue many of these areas, the department offers several options within the major.\n \nThe major requires a solid foundation in mathematics and the physical sciences, and it provides a comprehensive survey of the fundamentals of atmospheric science. It has sufficient flexibility to permit intensive advanced study in such related areas as mathematics, Earth sciences, or engineering. The department has particular strengths in weather analysis and prediction, including forecast uncertainty and severe weather; physical meteorology, including radar meteorology, instrumentation and atmospheric measurements; and applied areas, including atmospheric diffusion, air pollution chemistry, dynamic meteorology, tropical meteorology, climate, weather risk, and remote sensing.\n \nGraduating meteorologists are prepared for professional employment with industry, private consulting firms, government, and the armed forces or for further study toward graduate degrees normally required for research, university, or management positions.\n \nThe first and second years are largely devoted to preparatory work in science, mathematics, and the liberal arts. The junior and senior years involve a core of basic courses in applied and theoretical topics and a choice of courses offering specialized training. The courses unique to each option are normally taken in the junior and senior years.\n \nAtmospheric Science Option\n \nThis option challenges students to strengthen and broaden their understanding of the physics and chemistry of both the atmosphere and oceans. It helps prepare them for employment in the diverse field of the atmospheric sciences and for graduate study in the atmospheric or related disciplines. Students are encouraged to participate in undergraduate research projects under the supervision of atmospheric and oceanic scientists in the department college.\n \nEnvironmental Meteorology Option\n \nEnvironmental Meteorology prepares the student for understanding the impact of the weather and climate on the environment, which is to say the impacts of air and water on natural and human-altered ecosystems. In order to do this, the option establishes links between atmospheric physics and a variety of environmental disciplines pertaining to land, water, soils, and plants. Depending on his/her interests, the student will select courses in Air Quality and Dispersion, Ecology, Environmental Chemistry, Geographic Information Systems, or Hydrology.\n \nGeneral Option\n \nThis option has sufficient flexibility to serve the needs of students who wish to pursue topics chosen broadly from subdisciplines of meteorology or from related areas in consultation with the academic adviser. The General option is appropriate both for students who intend to pursue postgraduate degrees and for students who want to emphasize a topic for which no option exists.\n \nWeather Forecasting and Communications Option\n \nThis option prepares students for careers in which their skills as weather forecasters are effectively used in a variety of ways, from science reporting and television broadcasting to web design and computer-based weather graphics production, and developing innovative applications of weather and climate data to industry.\n \nWeather Risk Management Option\n \nThe option combines study of meteorology and atmospheric sciences with training in risk, finance, and quantitative decision-making. Weather affects a wide range of industries, including energy, agriculture, insurance, construction, retail, and transport, among others. Weather and climate variation play central roles in the availability of water resources, the spread of disease, and an array of other processes vital for human welfare. There are, consequently, many organizations that confront risks related to weather, and that have a demand for experts who can help them manage these risks. The option in Weather Risk Management is designed for students who wish to work professionally at this intersection of meteorology and risk management.\n\n\nWhat is Meteorology and Atmospheric Science?\n\n\nMeteorology is one of the oldest of modern sciences. The word itself was coined by Aristotle more than 2,000 years ago for the first book on the science of \u201cthings lifted up.\u201d Meteorology and atmospheric science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific principles to explain, understand, observe, and forecast the behavior of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Meteorologists and atmospheric scientists explore the significance of weather and climate as it relates to the environmental, energy, agricultural, oceanic, and hydrological sciences. From severe weather, numerical weather prediction, and climate change to weather risk and air pollution\u2014there\u2019s no shortage of practical applications in meteorology and atmospheric science.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in applying mathematics, physics, and computer programming to real-world problems.\n\n\nYou are fascinated with weather, climate, or the environment.\n\n\nYou are a self-described \"weather geek.\"\n\n\nYou would like to be a \u201cweather communicator\u201d such as a television meteorologist or science writer.\n\n\nYou want to study global warming and the Earth's changing climate.\n\n\nYou would like to work with data from satellites, radar, and other environmental sensors.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nMining contributes to nearly 15 percent of the U.S. and 25 percent of the global economy. Mined products are significant and critical inputs to food production, manufacturing, construction, and electricity supply, and each year every person in the U.S. requires an average of 38,500 pounds of new minerals to equip and power their day-to-day activities. Over 14,000 mines distributed throughout the U.S. supply the majority of these mined products.\n \nThe Penn State Mining Engineering program prepares students for a career in the industrial minerals, metals, and energy industries that sustain the domestic and global economies. Importantly, the program provides an emphasis on sustainable mining through integration of environmental health and safety, and societal responsibility principles in the design and operation of mineral enterprises.\n \nGraduates of the program will be prepared to work domestically or internationally to develop and operate mines; or to work in supporting activities including engineering consulting, banking, equipment development and supply, regulatory enforcement, and research. This is accomplished primarily through the curriculum, but is enhanced by an internship program, which allows qualified students to obtain practical experience through structured employment opportunities in the private and public sectors.\u00a0\n \nThe curriculum is built on the foundation of mathematics, science, and general education common to engineering majors at Penn State. The courses specific to this major are designed and sequenced to provide an appropriate blend of theory, application, and design. The required courses help to provide the enabling skills for graduates to work in any facet of the vast minerals industry, and technical electives allow for in-depth study of more specialized topics. The general education opportunities are sufficiently broad and diverse in nature and scope to enable the student to tailor the educational experience to particular interests, backgrounds, and expected roles in society.\n \nStudent-Trainee Program\n \nAn internship program and a five-year work-study plan are available to incoming students in Mining Engineering. Numerous mining and manufacturing companies, as well as government agencies, cooperate with the University to offer structured employment opportunities during the student\u2019s academic career. In addition to earning significant funds to help finance their education, these opportunities provide valuable practical and professional experience prior to graduation. The internships normally take place in the summer, and the B.S. degree can be earned in four years. The work-study plan consists of alternating six-month periods of employment and schooling, and requires five years to earn the B.S. degree. Additional information can be obtained from the department.\n\n\nWhat is Mining Engineering?\n\n\nMining today means computer design and automation, surveying and monitoring with drones, developing and refining our resources for critical metals and fuels, improving health and safety, and promoting sustainability principles. The supply chain for transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, energy, and defense relies on mining. Mining engineers touch all aspects of resource recovery from mine planning through production through refining to final reclamation of mined lands. They are found in mines, processing plants, engineering consulting companies, and corporate board rooms. Their job may see them in the field one day and engrossed in plans and designs in an office the next. They put all their engineering skills to use.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to join a high-tech industry that provides metals, fuels and materials for every industry.\n\n\nYou want to face new opportunities and challenges every day.\n\n\nYou want to be a problem solver.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe overall educational objective of the Nuclear Engineering program is to help prepare our graduates to function effectively in the marketplace in a wide range of career paths in Nuclear Engineering. The technical part of the curriculum, emphasizes nuclear power engineering, which refers to complex systems used to generate electricity. Because of our strong educational and research emphasis in nuclear power engineering, and because a shortage for this expertise exists in the industry, generally the industry values our graduates highly. We recognize that nuclear science, including nuclear security and non-proliferation, is an important growth area. We constantly assess and review the needs of our undergraduate students and their most frequent employers and use this feedback to consider revisions to our curriculum so that it is responsive to the needs of our constituents.\n \nThe first two years of the program stress fundamentals in mathematics, chemistry, physics, computer programming, and engineering sciences such as mechanics, materials, and thermodynamics. The last two years provide the breadth and depth in nuclear science, behavior of heat and fluids, reactor theory and engineering, and radiation measurement. The laboratory work includes experiments using the University's 1,000-kilowatt research reactor. Engineering design is incorporated in many courses from the freshman year to the senior year, but is particularly emphasized in the senior capstone design course, which integrates the critical elements of reactor theory, reactor engineering, safety considerations and economic optimization into a reactor design.\n \nMany graduates are employed by electric power companies that use nuclear power plants, or by companies that help service and maintain those plants. They use their knowledge of engineering principles, radioactive decay, interactions of radiation with matter, and nuclear reactor behavior to help assure that the power plants meet the demand for reliable, economic electricity while ensuring a safe environment. To do this, graduates must be problem solvers who can develop and use complex computer models and sophisticated monitoring systems, design systems to handle radioactive waste, determine if the materials in the plant are becoming brittle or corroded, or manage the fuel in the reactor to get the maximum energy from it. Other graduates work in industries that use radioactivity or radiation to detect problems or monitor processes. Jobs are also found in branches of the government as designers of the next generation of reactors for submarines, aircraft carriers, or space probes, or to manage and clean up contaminated wastes. They could also be involved with regulation of nuclear power or radiation uses, or in research to develop advanced technologies that will be used in next-generation power plants. Graduates who want to further their education in the fields of health physics, radiation biology, or nuclear medical applications find this degree to be a useful preparation.\n\n\nWhat is Nuclear Engineering?\n\n\nNuclear Engineering is a multidisciplinary field that goes beyond providing nuclear power for electrical production. Nuclear engineers may apply their knowledge in various fields, including disease treatment, safeguarding food supplies, operate nuclear energy systems, develop regulations to ensure safety, or facilitate space exploration.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are interested in using basic science to make the world a better place for humankind through the production of clean energy, keeping the country safe from nuclear attack, and the application of nuclear science.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe Associate in Science in Occupational Therapy Assistant Program prepares students to work in numerous practice settings, guided by the supervision of occupational therapists. Across the lifespan, individuals engage in meaningful occupations. Learning, playing, working, resting, and caring for self and others are among the occupations of life. A physical or psychological challenge may hinder an individual, group, and/or community from participating fully in meaningful occupations. Occupational therapy makes it possible for people to maintain or reclaim independence; thereby positively engaging in Living Life to its Fullest\u2122. Upon successful graduation from the program, students must sit for and successfully pass the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT) national certification examination to practice. Most states also require licensure as a condition for employment. A felony conviction may affect a graduate's ability to sit for the NBCOT certification examination and obtain licensure. NBCOT may be contacted at:\n \nNBCOT\n One Bank Street\n Suite 300\n Gaithersburg, MD 20878\n 301-990-7979\n \nwww.NBCOT.org\n \nTo enter this major, students must have a high school diploma or its equivalent. To be admitted to degree candidacy, the applicant must have completed educational background requirements called Carnegie Units or Secondary School Units. Students are responsible for proof of liability insurance and other requirements specified by the facility providing supervised field experience.\n \nThe size of each entering class is limited so that optimal clinical experiences and practical application situations can be maintained. Students are expected to progress through the program in the prescribed manner. Fieldwork affiliations are maintained within a specified geographical area. Students may be required to make special housing and transportation arrangements during the fieldwork phase. Students must complete all Level II fieldwork within eighteen months of successful completion of OTA didactic course work. The 2OTCC and 2OTBL curricula are delivered in five semesters.\n\n\nWhat is Occupational Therapy?\n\n\nOccupational therapy is a practice informed by physical, psychological, and occupational science. It is with these skills and knowledge; occupational therapy assistants employ intervention plans that engage people in maintaining or reclaiming independence. A physical or psychological challenge may hinder an individual, group, and/or community from participating fully in meaningful occupations. When this occurs an occupational therapy assistant works with the client(s) to design a plan to Live Life to its Fullest\u2122. As a certified occupational therapy assistant, you will work in numerous practice settings, guided by the supervision of occupational therapists. Most importantly, by choosing a career in occupational therapy, you will be at the forefront in making a difference in people\u2019s lives by way of therapeutic use of self and an intentional relationship.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou want to work with individuals and groups across the lifespan. Occupational Therapy Assistants work in rehabilitation and acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, schools, community health centers, mental health facilities, pediatric specialty settings, and higher education, and can also create their own niches in a variety of settings. If you appreciate helping to solve problems and empower people, being an occupational therapy assistant may be the right fit for you!",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe fields of pharmacology and toxicology are by nature interdisciplinary biomedical sciences, drawing upon the foundations and approaches of cell biology, systems physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. A primary objective of pharmacology is to investigate fundamental aspects of cellular and molecular regulatory mechanisms for the purpose of understanding how drugs act and in order to develop new drugs for treatment of disease. Toxicology examines how chemical agents produce adverse effects on the organism, and studies mechanisms by which these materials contribute to cancer, neurological diseases, metabolic disorders and many other diseases and conditions. Our program is truly unique. One of the only eight majors in toxicology and pharmacology in the United States, it is the only one that blends molecular/cellular and environmental studies of toxicology and pharmacology.\n\n\nWhat is Pharmacology & Toxicology?\n\n\nPharmacology and toxicology study two sides of the same coin namely how do chemicals affect organisms positively (Pharmacology) or negatively (Toxicology). Toxicology as the study of the adverse effects of chemical, physical, or biological agents on people, animals, and the environment. It complements the study of Pharmacology, which examines the beneficial effects of chemical and biological agents. Pharmacologists and Toxicologists are scientists trained to investigate, interpret, and communicate the nature of beneficial as well as hazardous effects of manmade chemicals. These are interdisciplinary sciences, integrating information from biology and virtually all its subspecialties (e.g., genetics, endocrinology and molecular biology) as well as math, physics, and chemistry and its subspecialties (e.g., analytical, organic, and clinical chemistry).\n\n\nYou Might Like this Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to translate detailed knowledge of biology and biochemistry into a form that benefits human and ecological health as well as policy decisions\n\n\nYou want to study how new drugs are discovered and evaluated for health benefit as well as potential toxic responses\n\n\nYou appreciate that human-made chemicals released into the environment impact the ecosystem and want to understand how you define and manage safety",

Students enrolled in the program will acquire practical skills and learn creative techniques relevant to professional photographic image making. The degree program focuses on building and synthesizing career oriented competencies essential to photographers' professional, intellectual, and cultural lives.\n \nThe learning objectives and essential competencies of the Professional Photography major align with NASAD standards for undergraduate professional degrees. NASAD is the professional agency responsible for accrediting Penn State's art and design programs within the College of Arts and Architecture. This B. Des. in Professional Photography also addresses student career success and economic development.\n\n\nWhat is Photography?\n\n\nPhotography involves using image making technologies to take visual samples of the world around us to create responses, representations, and interpretations that cause us to think about what we see, and to question what we know. This creative and critical practice emerges from innumerable motivations that arise from a deep-felt desire for personal expression, or a belief that visual arts and design can influence how we encounter and understand everyday life. Whether exploring and applying photography as a means of responding to personal ideas and issues, or using image making to meet a client\u2019s expectations, the discipline requires a range of specialized knowledge and skills in the use of tools, techniques, technologies, and processes to enable working from a concept to finished photographic forms. Hence, developing your individual visual language as a photographer involves mastery of materials, equipment, and processes, and developing a vision of aesthetic forms, functions, and content relationships.\n\n\nYou Might Like this Program If...\n\n\nYour personal interests and professional aspirations are inspired by the power of photography to reach into our lives to capture the diversity, complexity, and humanity. Virtually all visual information we encounter online and in print media relies on photography to communicate content in visually stimulating and aesthetically pleasing ways. Although photographic images are found in many disciplines, the art of photography remains firmly embedded within the imagination of seeing.\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY",

The major is integrative in nature by crossing traditional business boundaries while offering specific areas of study in enterprise risk management, and real estate. High profile risks are faced by leaders and managers up and down the corporate ladder and require specialized skills, knowledge, and preparation. The Risk Management major prepares students for this along with a chance to study risk from various perspectives by offering specialty courses along with a common pool of risk management courses. This structure assures that the students in the risk management major are equipped with the common tools of risk analysis while at the same time permitting the students to tailor the specifics of their training.\n \nEnterprise Management Option\n \nThe Enterprise Risk Management Option prepares students to identify, quantify and qualify the regulatory, legal, financial and contractual aspects of enterprise risk; the management of such risks; and the application of risk financing techniques to control risk exposures in organizations. Emphasis is also placed on the understanding of the principles and risks underlying complex business contracts.\n \nReal Estate Option\n \nThis option is designed to prepare the student for a wide range of professional opportunities in corporate real estate management, real estate brokerage, appraisal, property management, mortgage lending and banking, development, and governmental service.\n\n\nWhat is Risk Management?\n\n\nOrganizations face a wide array of risks in today's rapidly changing and complex business environment. Operations can be disrupted by a variety of unanticipated factors, ranging from external forces like natural disasters and political risks to internal factors like faulty product design and flawed financial systems. CEOs make risky strategic decisions in an increasingly competitive marketplace where the cost of missteps is high. In recent years, firms have encountered new risks in the form of financial mismanagement, global litigation, and the growing costs of human resources.\n\n\nThe goal of Risk Management is to enhance firm value through the optimal treatment of risk. Corporate interest in enterprise risk management has grown steadily in recent years, fueled in part by regulatory mandates for improved risk management systems. In addition, organizations like Standard & Poor\u2019s, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the New York Stock Exchange now require increased risk management disclosure and assessment in corporate financial statements.\n\n\nRisk Management can often be categorized into four general areas of risk:\n\n\n\n\nHazard Risk: Lawsuits or damage from natural disasters.\n\n\nOperational Risk: Risk resulting from failed systems, poor design, or worker error.\n\n\nFinancial Risk: Excessive operating costs and changes in commodity prices or currencies.\n\n\nStrategic Risk: Corporate gains and losses from changes in consumer demand.\n\n\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT",

Students completing the major will have the technical skills to handle, analyze, apply and present big data, and the disciplinary knowledge to draw valid inferences from such information to address real world problems. The program integrates coursework in the social sciences with courses in statistics, mathematics, information science and computer science to develop the unique skill set necessary to conceptualize data sources in relation to the social conditions from which they arise; to think critically about big data in relation to specific problems; and to derive and test hypotheses through application of data tools and techniques. Students will gain valuable practical experience working with data through a capstone experience and participation in faculty research.\n \nThis major is intended to produce graduates who are big picture thinkers with the knowledge to formulate good questions and leverage vast stores of unstructured data in answering them. Students will be prepared for careers in government, business, healthcare, and industry. The major also provides a strong foundation for advanced study in social science, law, business and public policy.\n\n\nWhat is Social Data Analytics?\n\n\nSocial Data Analytics (SoDA) is an interdisciplinary major that teaches students to use the increasingly vast stores of information generated from social media, cell phones, \u201csmart objects\u201d and other technology that captures moment to moment changes in where people are, what they are doing and thinking, and with whom they are associating. This data (often called \u201csocial data\u201d or \u201cbig data\u201d) can help researchers and policy makers address a wide variety of political, economic and social problems. It can be used, for example, to improve government services; to identify patterns of armed conflict, human rights abuses, and disease before they escalate; to enhance the efficiency of businesses; and to create more resilient communities in the face of climate change. Students in this major learn data analysis techniques and how to apply them to develop reliable answers to questions about the social and political world.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou want to develop data analytics skills to solve real-world problems in the political, social, and economic arenas.

Students will be engaged in the scholarly study of social issues, and they will have clinical experiences in community-based organizations, foundations, and government offices.\n\n\nWhat is Social Work?\n\n\nThe primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance human well-being and help meet the basic human needs of all people, with particular attention to the needs and empowerment of people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. A historic and defining feature of social work is the profession\u2019s dual focus on individual well-being in a social context and the well-being of society. Fundamental to social work is attention to the environmental forces that create, contribute to, and address problems in living. Social workers promote social justice and social change with and on behalf of clients. Social workers are sensitive to cultural and ethnic diversity and strive to end discrimination, oppression, poverty, and other forms of social injustice.\n\n\n(National Association of Social Workers, 2022)\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou have a desire to promote social justice and social change in society\n\n\nYou enjoy engaging with diverse individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities\n\n\nYou are enthusiastic about helping others cope effectively during challenging times\n\n\nYou are passionate about alleviating poverty and improving living conditions\n\n\nYou are interested in helping people manage acute medical conditions, chronic stress, and illnesses\n\n\nYou are fascinated about providing mental health and substance use treatment services",

Graduates have the background to seek employment in a variety of public and private sector jobs, to pursue graduate study in sociology or related areas, or to enter professional schools in social work, law, business, or health fields.\n \nStudents may choose either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree program. The B.A. degree in Sociology is a classic liberal arts degree. The B.S. degree is intended for students with a strong interest in quantitative skills. Students completing the B.S. degree have additional training in mathematics and other social science disciplines.\n \nOpportunities to work as departmental teaching and research assistants are available. Students are encouraged to participate in study abroad and/or internship experiences while enrolled in either the B.A. or B.S. sociology majors.\n \nGraduates of this program have found positions in social research, social service agencies, government and business research and planning offices, other business positions (especially sales and marketing), or have entered graduate school in sociology, social work, policy analysis or law school.\n\n\nWhat is Sociology?\n\n\nSociology is the scientific study of social behavior and human social groups. The topics covered in sociology are as diverse as society itself, from families to gangs, from non-profit organizations to nations. Sociology focuses on the ways that groups and individuals interact, examining how social environments, like neighborhoods, schools, religious organizations, workplaces, and social networks shape individuals' behaviors and create cooperation or conflict. Sociology uses different methods (surveys, interviews, network analysis, observation, social media, censuses, case studies) to make the invisible patterns of the social world visible.\n\n\nSociology especially helps us understand the roots of racial, gender, and class inequality by investigating the ways that social groups control resources, enforce social boundaries, and accept unequal social outcomes. But sociology also helps us to understand how societies change, whether due to the impact of large-scale events like pandemics and economic recessions, or through social movements and labor unions.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to understand how society influence our lives, both in the United States and throughout the global community.\n\n\nYou would like to learn skills for social research, group facilitation, or organizational leadership.\n\n\nYou want to pursue a career in research, law, social work, business, community organizing, social entrepreneurship, education, non-profit organizations, public policy, counseling, or the health professions.\n\n\nYou want to understand social inequality as well as social change.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe BA in Theatre asks students to consider the theatrical past, to reflect on their reasons for doing theatre now, and to imagine what theatre can be in the future. Students take a broad range of courses in theatre theory and practice. They gain experience as dramaturgs and assistant directors for the School of Theatre Penn State Centre Stage. Many direct, design, and perform in B.A. projects and productions, and through Penn State's many student theatre and dance groups. We are particularly interested in drawing students to our program who are curious about theatre itself, and who wish to explore it through devising their own performances, writing plays, and directing and producing their own shows. The B.A. is also Penn State's home for dance studies, offering technique classes as well as a range of dance history and theory courses.\n \nStudents who pursue the B.A. in Theatre learn to research, analyze and synthesize information. Majors develop strong oral and written skills and many go on to postgraduate study not only in theatre but also in areas such as law, business and education.\n\n\nWhat is Theatre?\n\n\nTheatre is a collaborative art form; an art form where different disciplines converge to create a sensorial experience much greater than the sum of its parts. Theatre is history, culture, entertainment and social responsibility. Theatre engages and transforms. Theatre is storytelling, told with equal parts artistry, skill, and technology. A theatre artist is a resourceful problem solver, effective communicator, and a great collaborator. These life skills empower theatre professionals to pursue their individual paths and rise up to their potential, well beyond the theatre walls and into their everyday life.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are a playwright, director, or dramaturg--or want to learn more about these practices.\n\n\nYou enjoy devising, seeing, and writing about performance.\n\n\nYou want to practice your theatre studies crafts in a department with a pre-professional season of plays and musicals.\n\n\nYou plan to pursue an MFA in Dramaturgy or a PhD in Theatre or Performance Studies after graduation.\n\n\nYou are transferring from another Commonwealth campus, and you would like to deepen your study of theatre.",

Further, completers of this B.S. degree and option may also become eligible for the English as a Second Language (ESL) credential by completing six additional credits, i.e., \nAPLNG\u00a0410\n or \nAPLNG\u00a0484\n, and \nAPLNG\u00a0493\n.\n \nCandidates are expected to have taken their choice of language coursework beyond the intermediate level to be eligible for enrollment in \nFR\u00a0201\n, or \nGER\u00a0201\n, or \nLATIN\u00a0400\n, or \nRUS\u00a0204\n, or \nSPAN\u00a0200\n. In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in the chosen language each semester without interruption. Participation in an approved Education Abroad Study Program is required, typically during semester six.\n \nEnglish as a Second Language (ESL) Teaching Option\n \nThis option will lead to a baccalaureate degree only in conjunction with one of the other companion World Language Education Teaching options.\n \nThe ESL Teaching option is a joint offering of the Department of Curriculum and Instruction in the College of Education and the Department of Linguistics and Applied Language Studies in the College of the Liberal Arts. Dr. Youb Kim, Assistant Professor of Education and Applied Linguistics, and Joan Kelly Hall, Professor of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics, are co-directors of the program.\n \nThis option prepares candidates for advanced work in ESL and for the Pennsylvania teacher credential Program Specialist: English as a Second Language (ESL). However, the Pennsylvania Department of Education only issues the Program Specialist: ESL credential to holders of Pennsylvania Instructional I or II certificates. Thus, completers of another World Languages Education Teaching option may first seek the Pennsylvania Instructional certificate in that language and may then add the Program Specialist: ESL credential, subsequently.\n \nFrench Teaching Option\n \nCompletion of this option and pertinent tests required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education lead to the Pennsylvania Instructional I teacher certificate in French. Candidates are expected to have taken French coursework beyond the intermediate level to be eligible for enrollment in \nFR\u00a0201\n. In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in French each semester without interruption.

Candidates are expected to have taken German coursework beyond the intermediate level to be eligible for enrollment in \nGER\u00a0201\n. In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in German each semester without interruption. Participation in an approved Education Abroad Study Program is required, typically during semester six.\n \nLatin Teaching Option\n \nCompletion of this option and pertinent tests required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education lead to the Pennsylvania Instructional I teacher certificate in Latin. Candidates are expected to have taken Latin coursework beyond the intermediate level to be eligible for enrollment in \nLATIN\u00a0400\n. In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in Latin each semester without interruption.

In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in Russian each semester without interruption. Participation in an approved Education Abroad Study Program is required, typically during semester six.\n \nSpanish Teaching Option\n \nCompletion of this option and pertinent tests required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education lead to the Pennsylvania Instructional I teacher certificate in Spanish. Candidates are expected to have taken Spanish coursework beyond the intermediate level to be eligible for enrollment in \nSPAN\u00a0110\n. In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in Spanish each semester without interruption.

Methods of instruction draw upon the strategies and techniques of practicing writers outside of the University, including workshops, peer conferencing, collaborative writing, portfolio preparation, and internships. At the same time, theory courses provide the necessary background to help students understand and appreciate the larger issues surrounding the writing and reading of texts.\n \nAs a liberal arts degree, the Writing and Digital Media major is appropriate for students who wish to develop a set of applied communication skills to prepare for a wide range of professional positions or for graduate or professional schools. The degree differs from most current English majors in at least three ways:\n \n \na practical orientation prepares graduates for employment, in addition to post-graduate English studies;\n \na multidisciplinary focus integrates courses from the liberal arts, business, and information technology; and\n \na required internship ensures that students actively apply their skills.\n \n\n\nWhat is Writing and Digital Media?\n\n\nIf you enjoy expressing thoughts and ideas through the written word, the B.A. in Writing and Digital Media may be the right degree for you. A degree in Writing and Digital Media will prepare you to write effectively in a variety of workplace and academic settings. It involves the use of precise language to convey information in a way that is easily understood by its intended audience, and it may be used to inform, persuade, instruct, or encourage action. Employers seek graduates with effective writing skills, and the broad nature of this degree opens doors to a variety of careers and to graduate school.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou enjoy communicating thoughts, ideas, and concepts through the written word.\n\n\nYou are interested in a degree that emphasizes writing and will provide skills that employers seek.\n\n\nYou like the flexibility of a broad, liberal arts major that will prepare you to enter a variety of fields or to enter graduate school.\n\n\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT WRITING AND DIGITAL MEDIA",
