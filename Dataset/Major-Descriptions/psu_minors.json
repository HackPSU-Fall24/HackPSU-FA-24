It is designed to introduce students to advanced topics in financial and cost accounting, as well to the basics of income tax accounting for individuals. This minor can provide an enhanced understanding of accounting information flows, costing systems, and the general tax environment to students majoring in other business areas, and it is a particularly good compliment to the finance and management information systems majors. On its own, it will not generally enable students to meet the requirements for professional licensing in accounting.\n\n\nWhat is Accounting?\n\n\nAccountants develop and interpret financial data required for decision-making by managers, investors, regulators, and other stakeholders. To perform their functions, accountants must work with both numerical information and concepts, and they must be able to function effectively as individuals and in teams. Accountants work with people in their own specialized departments, and with users of financial information throughout their organization. Because of this close association with other parts of the organization, the accountant is in a unique position to develop a broad business perspective.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou enjoy numbers and working with technology.\n\n\nYou are a business major who wants additional education in accounting.",

The rise in the number of individuals struggling with addiction and recovery, the increased potency and administration of some drugs, and the specific needs of certain sub-groups within the addictions population are contributing to the complex landscape of addictions and recovery. Upon completion of the minor, students will have the knowledge and skills to support development and administration of programs designed to improve outcomes for those struggling with addictions and recovery.\n \nStudents completing the minor will be able to take courses across multiple disciplines as a way to view this phenomenon from various perspectives. The courses that comprise the minor are organized into recommended tracks that will permit students to select combinations of courses that will best compliment their major studies and prepare them for future professional goals. One track provides a pathway to certification as a drug and alcohol counselor for those who successfully complete their bachelor's degree in a behavioral science major in addition to the minor coursework. Students pursing this career path are encouraged to select courses that support the learning domains for the Certified Alcohol and Drug Counseling (CADC) certification in the state of Pennsylvania.

When people create or respond to art, they make connections between themselves and the experiences of others. In some cases, art provides a private encounter whereby individual thoughts and feelings are expressed through art, or recognized in the art of someone else. In other cases, art gives form to ideas and issues that concern entire communities. It is because art extends personal and public awareness that it is highly valued as a cultural activity. Those who make art and write about art offer imaginative insights that challenge us to see things differently. By creating artworks yourself, and enhancing your capacity to interpret artworks made by other individuals, communities, and cultures, you contribute to one of the most important purposes of art, which is to celebrate this unique human form of social communication that shapes the way we see ourselves.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are intrigued by not only coming to know different things as you learn, but want to increase your creative capabilities to come to know things differently.

One or more metropolitan areas in our increasingly crowded world will have experienced a devastating earthquake or volcanic eruption, sea level rise will be inundating low-lying coastal cities such as Jakarta along with whole island nations, energy resources will be less available and more expensive, and our climate will be warmer and characterized by more frequent extreme weather events.\n How we choose to plan for and attempt to mitigate these \"grand challenges\" will have consequences for individuals, nations, and our global socioeconomic and political systems.\n \nPersonal and collective actions are needed to ensure the sustainable use of our natural resources and environmental systems\u2014land, air, and water\u2014in an ethical and responsible manner. The United States needs to build robust educational pathways for its citizenry to develop the global perspective, cultural sensitivity, economic wisdom, and scientific acumen to inform their actions and address these grand challenges. The geosciences (marine, Earth, and atmospheric sciences) that explain the workings of the Earth system\u00a0 provide critical insight into all of these challenges and, consequently, must be firmly integrated into those educational pathways. These programs seek to promote that integration through engaging the geoscience community and their colleagues in allied disciplines in the development of high-quality educational materials, and mechanisms by which these materials can be effectively brought to large numbers of students.\n \nThe goal of this minor is to dramatically increase geoscience literacy of undergraduate students, including\u00a0\u00a0 the large majority that do not major in the geosciences, and especially adult learners through the online program, such that they are better positioned to make sustainable decisions in their lives and as part of the broader society.\n\n\nWhat is Earth and Sustainability?\n\n\nThe Earth and Sustainability minor program is designed to provide students with the knowledge needed to make well-informed, environmentally sustainable decisions. It increases geoscience literacy and addresses key sustainability issues, such as the impact of climate change on Earth and its inhabitants, access to clean drinking water, sustainable energy, and the hazards posed by our overpopulated coastal regions.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are passionate about sustainability and the environment.\n\n\nYou want a better understanding of the science behind and potential effects of climate change.\n\n\nYou want to know more about the complexities, challenges, and opportunities involved in planning for the Earth's future.\n\n\nYou would like to explore both the scientific and the social aspects of big problems like population growth, resource management, and climate change.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe Engineering Mechanics minor helps students prepare to analyze and/or design simple structures that are efficient and safe under foreseen loading conditions.\n \nContemporary engineering design of mechanical components requires precise information and modern analysis techniques to determine material response to anticipated loading. Designers must have the analytical and experimental tools to accurately define deformation under load to characterize dynamic response and to prevent mechanical failure. In the event of failure the cause(s) must be ascertained to prevent future failure through redesign and/or material substitution. Thus, industry has a real need for those with a sound foundation in Engineering Mechanics, the engineering science that deals with the effects of forces and torques on rigid and deformable bodies. Engineering Mechanics consists of Statics (bodies in equilibrium), Dynamics (bodies in unsteady motion such as vibration, moving on curvilinear paths) and the Mechanics of Deformable Media. The latter topic covers the change in dimensions of bodies of various shapes under the influence of forces, torques, temperature, and dynamic motion. Further failure criteria under such loadings are introduced and utilized in examples of engineering design. Some twenty undergraduate courses covering the above topics are available at two levels, i.e. sophomore introductory and senior (400) courses.\n\n\nWhat is Engineering Mechanics?\n\n\nEngineering mechanics is the engineering science that deals with the effects of forces and torques on particles, rigid bodies, or deformable media. Mechanics is typically subdivided into statics, dynamics, and mechanics of deformable bodies. The Engineering Mechanics minor is for undergraduates who wish to supplement their engineering backgrounds with extensive study in mechanics. The high-tech industry has a significant need for individuals with a sound background in engineering mechanics. Industries such as aerospace, automotive, power, structures, and appliance regularly hire graduates who are competent in engineering mechanics.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou wish to wish to supplement your engineering background with extensive study in mechanics.\n\n\nYou enjoyed your introductory courses in Statics, Dynamics, and Mechanics of Materials and would like to learn more.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThis intercollege minor is designed for students across the disciplines who wish to prepare for addressing environmental issues or problems as professionals or citizens. The minor is available to all undergraduates regularly enrolled in a degree program at the University. The objectives are to allow students to gain the multiple perspectives necessary for understanding environmental issues as well as to increase skills in collaborating with those from very different disciplinary backgrounds to find acceptable solutions. Students will be challenged to move beyond the channels of thinking characteristic of their own discipline to new ways of knowing, new sensitivities, and new analytical approaches. The program will engage students actively in learning experiences outside their major course of study. This minor is intended not to replace existing minors but to be a true intercollege, interdisciplinary minor.\n \nAdvising for students in this minor and approval of curriculum exceptions will be available through the Environmental Inquiry adviser designated within each participating college.\n\n\nWhat is Environmental Inquiry?\n\n\nThis interdisciplinary, intercollege minor can enrich all areas of academic study with essential, cross- disciplinary understanding of crucial environmental issues and how they are being framed and tackled from both scientific and policy perspectives. The minor\u2019s coursework can give students a greater appreciation of the environment, a broader understanding of environmental issues and problems, and insight into alternative methods of inquiry. If you have a background in science but also have ambitions to do something about the environment, you might find that a lot of the decisions about the environment are made in political settings. To have success in improving the environment will require you to speak the language of policy makers. The minor can help you on this track, exposing students to both the scientific background needed to understand environmental issues as well as the social science you need to promote these issues successfully.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in how the human impact on the environment is becoming increasingly relevant as population grows, resources are consumed, and businesses and industries become ever more productive.\n\n\nYou are interested in the complex debates that engage professionals from all fields. Now, more than ever, concerned agencies, organizations, and companies seek individuals knowledgeable about these important issues with experience communicating with people in professions outside of their own.\n\n\nYou want to be familiar with current environmental issues across all professional fields.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe FDSYS minor will educate and prepare students for existing and emerging food systems careers by designing and delivering an integrative, interdisciplinary Food Systems minor that is learner-centered, experiential and stakeholder-responsive. The minor uses a competency-oriented approach to inform its curriculum, reflective interdisciplinary collaboration, and food systems stakeholder involvement.\n\n\nCompetencies and Guiding Principles of the Food Systems Minor\n\n\nA comprehensive ecology of knowledge framework emphasizes both what is taught, and how it is taught as mutually supportive components of education. The competencies of the minor are the what: the student learning objectives that graduates of the Food Systems minor are expected to demonstrate proficiency in. The guiding principles of the Food Systems minor are the how: they serve as a roadmap for how the courses and experiences in the minor will support the learning objectives.\n\n\nCompetencies\n\n\nStudents who complete the Food Systems Minor will:\n\n\n\n\nSolve complex problems: Analyze, plan, act on and evaluate solutions across multiple domains of the food system, including health, science, economics and business, community, agriculture, the food service industry, and policy.\n\n\nUse evidence from multiple ways of knowing (epistemologies) to analyze, select and assess food systems problems and solutions. Different knowledge include scientific, social, cultural, historical, political, indigenous, and local perspectives.\n\n\nRespect and critically reflect on one's own and others' perspectives and values to understand how these perspectives and values influence food systems decisions.\n\n\nBe civically engaged both locally and globally to enable positive change in food and agricultural systems.\n\n\n\n\nGuiding Principles\n\n\n\n\nExperiential learning. Courses and related activities will offer students place-based, learning experiences in food systems beyond the classroom, thereby integrating theoretical and practical knowledge. Activities will include engaged scholarship, internships, service learning, research, and other creative and professional work experiences. For example, the required Supervised Field Engagement Experience will provide opportunity for personalized work on food systems related topics, practice in stakeholder engagement, and network-building for students with potential future employers.\n\n\nInterdisciplinary problems and project-based learning. Problem-based learning, experiential and stakeholder-driven projects, and systems-oriented inquiry have been linked to positive student appraisal of competency development for individual courses (Galt et al. 2013). Courses and related experiences will incorporate pedagogies and curricula that emphasize students' engagement with interdisciplinary food system problem-posing (inquiry) and project-based learning, thereby placing students at the center of their learning.\n\n\nCommunity partnerships and engagement. Courses and related experiences will advance students' and community partners' knowledge, skills, and dispositions toward forming and maintaining partnerships in service towards food systems security and mutually beneficial community, health, and environmental sustainability goals.\n\n\nPersonal transformation through reflection. Courses and related experiences will provide opportunities for students, instructors, and allied partners to reflect (individually and collectively) upon their learning about a wide range of issues associated with environmental sustainability, economic development and community prosperity, justice and well-being with an intention to articulate change in one's own understandings.\n\n\nCollaboration and deliberation. Courses and related experiences will promote among students, instructors and allied partners opportunities to develop knowledge, skills and dispositions inherent to democratic/civic participation.\n\n\nCareer stakeholder engagement. Courses and related experiences will engage food systems stakeholders and prospective employers from government, industry and non-profit sectors. By assessing stakeholders' understandings of critical competencies for successful food systems work, Food Systems minor graduates will be better prepared to address current food system challenges and also achieve their personal and professional goals.",

As such, Classical Greek was the language of the first great democratic state; eventually, it became the standard dialect that was read and studied for more than a thousand years down through the era of the Roman and Byzantine empires. After the Classical period, the Greek language continued to evolve, forming a standard common dialect (koine Greek) that was used throughout the Hellenistic world of the eastern Mediterranean and beyond. This was the dialect used by the writers of the New Testament to make it accessible to the widest literate audience. The modern Greek language is its descendant, though greatly changed after more than a thousand years of linguistic development.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou hope to analyze some of the world\u2019s greatest classical texts in their original language.\n\n\nYou want to pursue a career or engage in graduate studies in fields such as archaeology, theater, philosophy, literature, religious studies, law, and more.\n\n\nYou are interested in gaining further insight into the societies.",

It remained in use, however, as a literary and liturgical language among the Jews, and there is a huge corpus of Hebrew literature from that period, through medieval times, and into the modern era.

The minor consists of 18 credits. A certificate is awarded to students who complete the requirements of the minor.\n \nFor more information on the Linguistics Program, visit our website:\u00a0\nhttp://linguistics.la.psu.edu\n.\n\n\nWhat is Linguistics?\n\n\nLinguistics is the scientific study of language: how it is structured, how it is acquired, how it is used to convey information, and how it changes over time. While many linguists do speak more than one language--or at least know how to approach the study of other languages--linguistics is much more than this. Through courses and a wide variety of research opportunities, our students explore how languages are structured (sentence structure, sound patterns, meaning and more), and how those structures are processed by the human brain. Since language is integral to all societies, linguists are interested in how language affects culture, and how social factors (place of birth, social class, ethnicity, gender, age, etc.) impact language use. We approach language from a global perspective, investigating commonalities and differences across languages in order to increase our understanding of what makes human communication unique.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou enjoy studying languages, particularly finding and applying grammatical patterns.\n\n\nYou are interested in communication, and learning more about the function of language(s) in society and how language structure and use varies depending on social context.\n\n\nYou like to think about how the human brain functions, and want to know more about language and cognition, language learning (by children or adults!), or how the brain handles multiple languages.\n\n\nYou like logic, computer programming, and/or abstract puzzles.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe Minor in Materials Science and Engineering prepares students to understand the materials properties, materials processing techniques, characterization methods, and selection criteria in implementing engineering solutions. The materials selection for cutting edge mechanical design requires precise and definite knowledge of choice of materials, processing route, and mechanical response in service conditions. The materials engineer must have a sound expertise on modeling and experimental tools validating microstructural, mechanical, and electrical properties requirements for a specific design application. Hence, a wide variety of industries such as aerospace, automotive, energy, biomedical, and electronics to name a few, have a demand for engineers with a strong background in materials engineering. The MMSE covers introductory courses and laboratories on materials science in general, properties and processing of materials, materials thermodynamics and kinetics, and characterization of mechanical, microstructural and electrical properties of materials. The introductory courses and labs provide the basic foundation on materials science and engineering; the rest of the courses provide advanced knowledge on properties and selection, processing techniques, and characterization methods. Moreover, thermodynamics and kinetics of materials systems and process are also introduced. The above mentioned topics are covered by offering courses from sophomore through senior level.\n\n\nWhat is Materials Science and Engineering?\n\n\nMaterials are ubiquitous. Materials play a role in every industry and facet of life. Materials science and engineering is an interdisciplinary study of the properties of matter and the exploration for new and creative uses of ceramics, metals, polymers and composites. Materials scientists and engineers study the entire life cycle of materials (production, synthesis and processing, manufacturing, use, recycling and reclamation) by employing science to solve engineering problems. This engineering discipline is unique in that our studies begin with understanding materials at the atomic scale, allowing for prediction and measurement of material properties, and creation of materials by design. What do you want to do with your career? Make alternative energy more economical? Improve human health, cure cancer? Provide clean drinking water to the world? Make transportation more efficient and environmentally friendly? Make everyday materials more sustainable?

Students survey and evaluate key dimensions of the medieval period across disciplinary boundaries. They develop skills in critical writing and in analyzing documents, monuments, contexts, and conventions of expression; consider emerging fields such as digital humanities and new media; and examine the abiding cross-cultural and trans-historical significance of historical, social, religious, creative, and linguistic developments from the medieval period. The minor allows students to combine courses, guided readings, and research projects in fields such as history, art, archaeology, literature, languages, philosophy, and religious studies.\n\n\nWhat is Medieval Studies?\n\n\nMedieval Studies is an interdisciplinary field that ranges widely across periods and geographies. We usually imagine the Middle Ages as the millennium between the end of classical antiquity and the start of the Renaissance. But concepts and institutions that we take as distinctively modern\u2014the individual, companionate marriage, the state, vernacular languages as expressions of national identity\u2014begin in the Middle Ages. And the Middle Ages return as a powerful source for imaginative expression in the art and literature of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and in digital culture in the twenty-first century.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to grow as an analytical thinker with good writing skills, the ability to synthesize disparate materials, and a deep sense of context.\n\n\nYou have an interest in studying a rich and dynamic period, and wish to further understand the time through its history, literature, philosophy, and culture.",

For the Portuguese Minor, students will need a minimum of 19 credits of Portuguese (at least 6 of which must be at the 400 level), with grades of C or better. Students will be able to select from a comprehensive list of courses that can count toward the Minor. Students are held to the requirements that are in effect when they officially declare the Minor. They can take more than the minimum 19 credits if they so desire; there is no penalty for students who change their minds and ultimately do not complete all the Minor requirements (i.e., they are not disqualified from graduating if they do not complete declared minor requirements; they simply do not receive the minor).\n\n\nWhat is Portuguese?\n\n\nPortuguese and Luso-Afro-Brazilian studies is the academic discipline concerned with studying the languages, cultural expressions, and peoples of the Lusophone, or Portuguese-speaking, world. Scholars in this discipline analyze literary and artistic works from Brazil, Portugal, and/or Lusophone Africa, often within a comparative context. This field contextualizes artistic and cultural expressions in terms of history, politics, social practices, and economics. Studies in this field may examine the experiences and expressions within the Lusophone context through the lens of Latin American studies, hemispheric American studies, or Transatlantic studies. Questions of race, gender, and class, the legacies of slavery and colonialism, and the repercussions of dictatorships and civil wars often animate research in this field.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to learn or improve your Portuguese and discover more about countries where Portuguese is spoken.\n\n\nYou are interested in how music, film, literature, and culture intersect with politics, social movements, and historical events.\n\n\nYou want to pursue a career in international business, government, non profits, translation, education, or the arts.",

In recognition of the diverse career opportunities in the modern poultry and game bird industries, the minor is designed to also accommodate students with primary interests in agribusiness management, food science, and wildlife science. Students are required to complete a minimum of 18 credits (9 credits at the 400 level). \nANSC\u00a0211\n, \nANSC\u00a0311\n, and \nANSC\u00a0425\n/\nVBSC\u00a0425\n provide a foundation of knowledge pertaining to both avian sciences and the commercial poultry industry, while additional courses selected by the student will allow for further specialization in the foundation animal science disciplines, agribusiness management, food science, and wildlife and fisheries science. In addition, credits from poultry or avian internship experiences and/or independent study projects may also be applied towards meeting the requirements of the minor.\n \nThe University's Poultry Education and Research Center is used extensively for supplementing classroom work with hands-on laboratories. The flexibility of the minor permits program planning commensurate with an individual's interests and professional goals, and should enhance the student's ability to compete for related positions in industry, government, or academia (graduate or professional school).\n\n\nWhat is Poultry and Avian Science?\n\n\nPoultry and Avian Science encompasses avian biology, management, and health. Domestic fowl, or poultry, are birds that are kept primarily for meat and eggs. The history of domestication of chickens and ducks dates back thousands of years to the Chinese, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, while turkeys served as food for Indians in North America as early as 1000 A.D. Chicken has become the world\u2019s preferred meat, and this has occurred because of tremendous scientific advances in breeding (genetics), physiology, nutrition, and management (husbandry). Besides food, poultry can provide fiber (e.g., down and feathers). Today\u2019s modern poultry industry is science-based, technologically advanced, efficient, and environmentally conscious. Animal health and well-being are integral components of overall management strategies. In addition to poultry, opportunities to learn about other avian species through course work and research are possible.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are passionate about birds and want to learn about avian biology, management, and health.\n\n\nYou like hands-on experiences in both caring for animals and/or conducting independent research projects.\n\n\nYou want to undertake industry internships.\n\n\nYou are interested in intercollegiate poultry judging.\n\n\nYou seek a career in a dynamic growing industry that feeds the world.\n\n\nYou want to pursue post-baccalaureate graduate (research) or professional degrees in avian biology or avian medicine.",

The topics covered in sociology are as diverse as society itself, from families to gangs, from non-profit organizations to nations. Sociology focuses on the ways that groups and individuals interact, examining how social environments, like neighborhoods, schools, religious organizations, workplaces, and social networks shape individuals' behaviors and create cooperation or conflict. Sociology uses different methods (surveys, interviews, network analysis, observation, social media, censuses, case studies) to make the invisible patterns of the social world visible.\n\n\nSociology especially helps us understand the roots of racial, gender, and class inequality by investigating the ways that social groups control resources, enforce social boundaries, and accept unequal social outcomes. But sociology also helps us to understand how societies change, whether due to the impact of large-scale events like pandemics and economic recessions, or through social movements and labor unions.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to understand how society influence our lives, both in the United States and throughout the global community.\n\n\nYou would like to learn skills for social research, group facilitation, or organizational leadership.\n\n\nYou want to pursue a career in research, law, social work, business, community organizing, social entrepreneurship, education, non-profit organizations, public policy, counseling, or the health professions.\n\n\nYou want to understand social inequality as well as social change.",

The competencies cut across all thematic tracks so that all students in the minor will develop capabilities in:\n \n \nsystems thinking\n \napplication of sustainability concepts, metrics and analysis\n \nethics\n \nself-knowledge and leadership\n \nchange agency\n \ncollaboration\n \n \nWhile these competencies are developed in the context of a specific thematic track, they are transferrable to numerous settings and problems, and graduates of the Sustainability Leadership program will be able to apply them to ethical, social, business and civic issues that they encounter after leaving the University.\n \nAll students in the minor are required to take the introductory course, \nFoundations of Leadership in Sustainability (\nSUST\u00a0200\n)\n. Within each thematic track, students select twelve credits related to the chosen theme in sustainability leadership. These must include three credits of approved leadership coursework (scholarly explorations of leadership concepts related to the chosen theme) and three credits that offer an immersive experience in sustainability (that is, an opportunity to engage, observe and learn in depth about sustainability challenges and solutions related to the student\u2019s chosen theme). The final three credits for each student in the minor is the 400-level Sustainability Leadership Capstone experience. Capstone selection is in consultation with the student\u2019s major adviser, the minor adviser or coordinator, and the course instructor. The capstone coursework must be relevant to the chosen theme, must have an approved capstone project that includes scholarly applied or theoretical research on a current issue in sustainability leadership, and must include a critical synthesis of the student\u2019s minor curriculum and an articulation of its crosscutting themes.\u00a0\n\n\nDesign for Sustainable Communities Track\n\n\nThis track allows students to investigate sustainability and leadership in community and urban planning; courses focus on both technical design and community development.\n\n\nEducating for Sustainability Track\n\n\nThis track provides students with the opportunity to explore a variety of approaches to sustainability education and leadership in sustainability.\n\n\nHumanistic Understanding of Sustainability Track\n\n\nThrough reading and analysis of significant sustainability-focused texts in philosophy, history, literature, and the social sciences students delve into the evolution and history of thinking on sustainability and leadership in sustainability.\n\n\nSustainability and Food Systems Track\n\n\nStudents in this track learn about the nature of food and sustainable food systems, and about sustainability policy and leadership issues related to food, including food security, sustainable production practices, distribution, and safety.\n\n\nApplicants to the minor present a proposed plan of study for the chosen minor track. The proposed plan of study must be approved by the student\u2019s major faculty adviser and by the minor adviser. Entrants to the minor are required to have declared a major field of study.\u00a0\n\n\nNew Sustainability Leadership minor tracks will be developed over time, and students are encouraged to consult with the minor coordinator early in their program planning, in order to be aware of upcoming additions to the curriculum. In exceptional cases, and by written approval of the program coordinator and major adviser, students may propose a specialized track of their own design.\n\n\nWhat is Sustainability Leadership?\n\n\nSustainability Leadership competencies cut across disciplines so that all students in the minor will develop capabilities in: systems thinking; application of sustainability concepts, metrics and analysis; ethics; self-knowledge and leadership; change agency; and collaboration. While these competencies are often developed in the context of particular disciplines, they are transferrable to numerous settings and problems. Graduates of the Sustainability Leadership program will be able to apply them to ethical, social, business and civic issues that they encounter after leaving the University.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou care about the state of the world.\n\n\nYou want to first develop expertise in sustainability themes through engaged scholarship experience in and out of the classroom.\n\n\nYou want to apply sustainability expertise to your own creative, innovative, and original capstone sustainability project.\n\n\nYou want to improve your marketability and employability for sustainability-related positions upon graduation.\n\n\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY LEADERSHIP",
