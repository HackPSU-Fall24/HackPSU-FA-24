    "Program Description": "Program Description\n\n\nThis major prepares students for careers in public, corporate, not-for-profit, and governmental accounting and also provides an appropriate background for those planning to enter law school or graduate school. Accountants develop and interpret historical and prospective financial data required for decision-making by managers, investors, regulators, and other stakeholders. To perform their functions, accountants must synthesize both numerical and qualitative information, communicate it clearly, and function effectively as individuals and in teams. The field of Accounting is diverse and offers students the opportunity to be generalists or concentrate in one of the following:\n \nCorporate Control & Financial Management\u00a0\n- Courses in this concentration prepare students for positions in industry, government, and business advisory services doing financial planning, analysis, control, and decision support. Students can obtain such designations as\u00a0\nCertified Management Accountant (CMA)\n. Management accountants provide forecasts, compute costs and benefits, perform variance analysis, and review and monitor performance. Managerial accountants also design systems that provide information to decision makers.\n \nInternal Auditing & Assessment\n\u00a0- Courses in this concentration prepare students for positions in industry and government as internal auditors. Students can obtain such designations as\u00a0\nCertified Internal Auditor (CIA).\u00a0\nInternal auditors are employed by the organization they audit. Internal auditing is a systematic approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. Internal auditors also review compliance with standards and assess the organization's risks.\n \nPublic Accounting\n\u00a0- Public accounting is carried on by independent practitioners, most of whom are Certified Public Accountants (CPAs). In addition to statutory audits, CPAs render other assurance, tax, and management advisory services. To be licensed as a CPA in nearly every state, including Pennsylvania, individuals must complete 150 credit-hours of education, pass a demanding professional examination, and meet certain experience requirements. One way to accomplish this is to enroll in the Integrated B.S. in Accounting and Master of Accounting Program.\n\n\nWhat is Accounting?\n\n\nAccountants develop and interpret financial data required for decision-making by managers, investors, regulators, and other stakeholders. To perform their functions, accountants must work with both numerical information and concepts, and they must be able to function effectively as individuals and in teams. Accountants work with people in their own specialized departments, and with users of financial information throughout their organization. Because of this close association with other parts of the organization, the accountant is in a unique position to develop a broad business perspective.\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT ACCOUNTING",
