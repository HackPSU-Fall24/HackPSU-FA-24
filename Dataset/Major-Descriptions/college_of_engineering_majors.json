Education in mathematics, physics, and engineering sciences common to all engineering disciplines is provided along with specialized training in biological and agricultural sciences. The curriculum covers all areas of biological engineering, including development of machines for biological processing and agriculture, postharvest handling and processing, natural resource management and utilization, biological processes, food engineering, and structures and their environmental modifications. A student must select the Agricultural Engineering option, Food and Biological Processing Engineering option, or the Natural Resources Engineering option.\n \nPrinciples of engineering design experiences are integrated throughout the third-year curriculum by having students solve problems typical of those encountered in the agricultural and biological engineering profession. A year-long major design experience in the fourth year emphasizes that biological engineers must learn not only how to develop engineering solutions to unique, practical problems using the newest technology, but also to assess and integrate the social and ethical implications of their solutions.\n \nCareers for graduates include design, development, and research engineering positions involving biological processes, machinery development, natural resources management, materials handling, biological product development, and structural systems for animals, plants, and crop storage. Biological engineers are employed in industry, consulting firms, and governmental agencies in the United States and abroad. Graduates deal with the various engineering aspects associated with production and processing of food, fiber, and other biological materials, within the constraints of environmental protection and natural resource conservation.\n\n\nWhat is Biological Engineering?\n\n\nBiological Engineering involves the study of engineering fundamentals, very similar to traditional engineering disciplines like chemical, civil, or mechanical engineering. What makes Biological Engineering unique is the integration of these engineering fundamentals with biological, agricultural, and environmental sciences and the holistic approach taken to studying agricultural production, processing of food and other bio-based materials, and natural resource protection. Problem-solving skills are developed and then applied to grand engineering challenges such as sustainably providing safe food and clean water.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou enjoy quantitative problem solving and working with your hands and/or working outdoors.\n\n\nYou are interested in a career where you address challenges related to fundamental societal needs, like food, water, fiber, and renewable energy.\n\n\nYou are passionate about sustainability.\n\n\nYou want to take application-focused classes with interactive labs and hands-on learning opportunities.",

Emphasis is placed on the fundamentals of civil engineering principles and design techniques. Students utilize basic engineering science concepts in several of the different specialty areas (e.g., construction/management, environmental, materials/pavement design/geotechnical, structures, transportation, and water resources). Finally the students are able to choose an area of specialization for professional practice or graduate studies.\n \nThe program is broadened by courses in communication, arts, humanities, social and behavioral sciences, as well as other engineering disciplines. Students gain experience in working as members of a team and using interdisciplinary approaches to solve problems. These experiences, as well as those related to engineering principles and design, are provided through exercises in the classroom, laboratory, and field. The program culmination is a capstone design course wherein the students' knowledge and skills are applied to actual engineering problems.\n\n\nWhat is Civil Engineering?\n\n\nCivil engineering is one of the oldest and most socially-relevant engineering disciplines. Grounded in mathematics and science, civil engineers make a lasting impact as they plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain the everyday, yet critical, infrastructure systems needed in our daily lives. In this challenging and diverse field, civil engineers also find solutions for critical environmental issues, including slowing the progress and mitigating the effects of climate change, eliminating the causes and treating the effects of environmental pollutants, and providing access to clean water. In recent years, the rapid application of new technologies has fostered the development of autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, smart structures, advanced materials, and new forms of renewable energy.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to design and build large-scale projects that last a long time.\n\n\nYou care about the quality of the water that comes out of the faucet.\n\n\nYou are interested in the operations and safety of future transportation systems.\n\n\nYou try to find sustainable solutions for every challenge, big or small.\n\n\nYou would like to use your technical skills in an exciting, people-serving profession.",

The primary objective is to provide a broad foundation of theoretical and practical knowledge in the areas of electrical and electronic circuits, digital circuits, computers, electrical machinery, and programmable logic controls.\n \nGraduates of the Electrical Engineering Technology major may qualify for admission to the baccalaureate degree majors in Electrical Engineering Technology offered at Penn State Harrisburg, Capital College; the baccalaureate degree major in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College; or the baccalaureate degree major in Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology offered at Penn State Altoona, Penn State Berks, Penn State New Kensington or Penn State York. Two baccalaureate tracks are available to streamline the transition to these degree programs. Students interested in pursuing the baccalaureate degree major of Electrical Engineering Technology at Penn State Harrisburg should follow track c. A general track is also provided for students who decide not to continue their engineering technology education at the baccalaureate level.\n\n\nWhat is Electrical Engineering Technology?\n\n\nElectrical engineering technology focuses on the planning, designing, installing, operating, and maintaining electrical power systems and electronic devices. Electrical engineering technicians assist engineers with the manufacture, installation, operation, design, and repair of a wide range of electronic products.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are interested in science and technology but prefer spending time applying your skills in a laboratory or field setting as opposed to studying the theory behind these subjects in a classroom setting. If you like to know how things that are controlled by electronics work, from computers to robotics, this may be for you. While theory is covered in this major, there is a greater emphasis on the application of theory with much of what you learn in the classroom being built as lab experiments.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe Bachelor of Science graduate with a major in Electrical Engineering Technology (EET) is an engineering technologist who can bridge the gap between scientific advancement and practical electrical devices and systems. Research in all fields of electrical engineering has produced an abundance of new knowledge in recent years. Many of these advanced scientific achievements have been unused due to the shortage of engineering technologists specifically educated to convert scientific information into practical devices and systems.\n \nThe EET major helps equip students with the various skills necessary to adapt new scientific knowledge to new products. Technical selections are offered in the senior year to provide some degree of specialization, but all graduates receive a well-rounded basic education in electrical and electronic design principles. The strengths of the program include: an applied hands-on program; extensive laboratory experience; promising job placement; and accreditation by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, telephone 410-347-7700, Web at \nhttps://www.abet.org\n.\n \nEET graduates who wish to continue their professional development can take the Fundamentals of Engineering examination in Pennsylvania, a prerequisite for taking the Professional Engineering examination.\n\n\nWhat is Electrical Engineering Technology?\n\n\nElectrical engineering technology (EET) is an engineering technology field that implements and applies the principles of electrical engineering. Like electrical engineering, EET deals with the design, application, installation, manufacturing, operation or maintenance of electrical/electronic systems. However, EET is a specialized discipline that has more focus on application, theory, and applied design, and implementation, while electrical engineering may have more of a generalized emphasis on theory and conceptual design.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou enjoy problem-solving and math.\n\n\nYou prefer practical rather than theoretical solutions, and application and implementation over conceptual modeling.\n\n\nYou enjoy working on multidisciplinary teams on complex problems.\n\n\nYou want to acquire knowledge to get a good job in industry.\n\n\nYou want to pursue a career as a technologist in sectors such as manufacturing, product design, testing, or technical services and sales.",

Designers must have the analytical and experimental tools to accurately define deformation under load to characterize dynamic response and to prevent mechanical failure. In the event of failure the cause(s) must be ascertained to prevent future failure through redesign and/or material substitution. Thus, industry has a real need for those with a sound foundation in Engineering Mechanics, the engineering science that deals with the effects of forces and torques on rigid and deformable bodies. Engineering Mechanics consists of Statics (bodies in equilibrium), Dynamics (bodies in unsteady motion such as vibration, moving on curvilinear paths) and the Mechanics of Deformable Media. The latter topic covers the change in dimensions of bodies of various shapes under the influence of forces, torques, temperature, and dynamic motion. Further failure criteria under such loadings are introduced and utilized in examples of engineering design. Some twenty undergraduate courses covering the above topics are available at two levels, i.e. sophomore introductory and senior (400) courses.\n\n\nWhat is Engineering Mechanics?\n\n\nEngineering mechanics is the engineering science that deals with the effects of forces and torques on particles, rigid bodies, or deformable media.

Mechanical engineers create things that help improve the health, happiness and safety of our everyday lives such as biomedical devices, aircraft and cars, and ways to store renewable energies. Mechanical engineering is divided into two broad areas: mechanical systems and thermal systems. Mechanical systems include the design of mechanisms and the analysis of the strength and wear of materials. Thermal systems include methods of energy conversions, heat transfer and fluid flow.\n\n\nWhat is Mechanical Engineering?\n\n\nMechanical engineering is the largest and broadest engineering discipline. It uses a combination of physics, chemistry, mathematics, and materials science to study mechanical, fluid, and thermal systems. Mechanical engineers are problem solvers: They use their foundational knowledge to apply scientific and engineering methods to the design, construction, and testing of products and components to ensure that they are safe, reliable, and cost effective. Mechanical engineering differs from mechanical engineering technology in that it emphasizes the math and science behind the theoretical development of engineering analysis and design process principles rather than the application of these principles. Mechanical engineers design everything from athletic equipment, medical devices, theme park rides, and personal computers to engines and power plants.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou think outside the box to develop solutions to everyday problems.

The technical part of the curriculum, emphasizes nuclear power engineering, which refers to complex systems used to generate electricity. Because of our strong educational and research emphasis in nuclear power engineering, and because a shortage for this expertise exists in the industry, generally the industry values our graduates highly. We recognize that nuclear science, including nuclear security and non-proliferation, is an important growth area. We constantly assess and review the needs of our undergraduate students and their most frequent employers and use this feedback to consider revisions to our curriculum so that it is responsive to the needs of our constituents.\n \nThe first two years of the program stress fundamentals in mathematics, chemistry, physics, computer programming, and engineering sciences such as mechanics, materials, and thermodynamics. The last two years provide the breadth and depth in nuclear science, behavior of heat and fluids, reactor theory and engineering, and radiation measurement. The laboratory work includes experiments using the University's 1,000-kilowatt research reactor. Engineering design is incorporated in many courses from the freshman year to the senior year, but is particularly emphasized in the senior capstone design course, which integrates the critical elements of reactor theory, reactor engineering, safety considerations and economic optimization into a reactor design.\n \nMany graduates are employed by electric power companies that use nuclear power plants, or by companies that help service and maintain those plants. They use their knowledge of engineering principles, radioactive decay, interactions of radiation with matter, and nuclear reactor behavior to help assure that the power plants meet the demand for reliable, economic electricity while ensuring a safe environment. To do this, graduates must be problem solvers who can develop and use complex computer models and sophisticated monitoring systems, design systems to handle radioactive waste, determine if the materials in the plant are becoming brittle or corroded, or manage the fuel in the reactor to get the maximum energy from it. Other graduates work in industries that use radioactivity or radiation to detect problems or monitor processes. Jobs are also found in branches of the government as designers of the next generation of reactors for submarines, aircraft carriers, or space probes, or to manage and clean up contaminated wastes. They could also be involved with regulation of nuclear power or radiation uses, or in research to develop advanced technologies that will be used in next-generation power plants. Graduates who want to further their education in the fields of health physics, radiation biology, or nuclear medical applications find this degree to be a useful preparation.\n\n\nWhat is Nuclear Engineering?\n\n\nNuclear Engineering is a multidisciplinary field that goes beyond providing nuclear power for electrical production. Nuclear engineers may apply their knowledge in various fields, including disease treatment, safeguarding food supplies, operate nuclear energy systems, develop regulations to ensure safety, or facilitate space exploration.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are interested in using basic science to make the world a better place for humankind through the production of clean energy, keeping the country safe from nuclear attack, and the application of nuclear science.",
