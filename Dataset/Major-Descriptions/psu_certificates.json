Diversity Studies however tends to focus on our own lived experiences, and how our perception of these markers influences personal and cultural interactions \u2013 especially our own! It investigates systems of power that organize our schools, workplaces, healthcare systems, criminal justice system, and media, many of them invisible to us. Around the globe those systems of power are organized very differently, sometimes in fundamental ways. Diversity Studies approaches differences intersectionally to expose, critique, and confront historical and contemporary sources of social and cultural conflict. This does not mean \u201clooking past\u201d differences; rather, looking straight at them to find the common ground and empathy that can make us better citizens.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to better understand people from different backgrounds.\n\n\nYou are interested in impacting social problems.\n\n\nYou want to stretch your own perspectives and actions.",

Our climate will be warmer and characterized by more frequent extreme weather events including droughts. One or more major metropolitan areas in our increasingly crowded world will have experienced a devastating hurricane or typhoon, sea level rise will be inundating low-lying coastal cities along with whole island nations, energy resources will be less available and more expensive, clean drinking water will be more scarce, and it will be increasingly difficult to feed the global population. How we choose to plan for and attempt to mitigate these \"grand challenges\" will have consequences for individuals, nations, and our global socioeconomic and political systems.\n \nThe goal of the 12-credit Certificate Program in Earth Sustainability is to dramatically increase geoscience literacy of all undergraduate students, including the large majority that do not major on the geosciences, future K-12 teachers, and also those who are historically underrepresented in the geosciences, such that they are better positioned to make sustainable decisions in their lives and as part of the broader society.\n\n\nWhat is Earth Sustainability?\n\n\nThe Earth Sustainability certificate program is designed to provide students with the knowledge needed to make well-informed, environmentally sustainable decisions. It increases geoscience literacy and addresses key sustainability issues, such as the impact of climate change on Earth and its inhabitants, access to clean drinking water, sustainable energy, and the hazards posed by our overpopulated coastal regions.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are passionate about sustainability and the environment.\n\n\nYou want a better understanding of the science behind and potential effects of climate change.\n\n\nYou want to know more about the complexities, challenges, and opportunities involved in planning for the Earth's future.\n\n\nYou would like to explore both the scientific and the social aspects of big problems like population growth, resource management, and climate change.",

Geospatial data derive from a rapidly expanding array of sources that include sensors (from satellites, to cameras and other sensing devices carried by UAVs, to distributed sensors monitoring energy consumption, pollution, traffic, and more with smart cities), GPS enabled devices (in vehicles, smart phones, cameras, human wearable devices, and even ones small enough to mount on migrating songbirds), citizen science efforts producing volunteered geospatial data, address-linked public health and many other records, retail transactions, and location-linked social media posts. As geospatial data become more ubiquitous, big digital geospatial data has become an essential part of geographic analysis. The 12-credit Geospatial Big Data Analytics certificate is aimed at students who are seeking advanced data collection, processing, analysis, and communication knowledge and skills related to leveraging the growing array of geographically linked big data. Courses for this certificate have prerequisites that are not included in requirements for the certificate; such prerequisites may be completed through the undergraduate Geographic Information Science certificate.\n \nLearning objectives: demonstrate an understanding of the breadth of methods and techniques available for handling large volumes of heterogeneous, rapidly-changing data; use multiple methods and techniques to conduct spatial analyses of big data and apply resulting analyses to problems within the student\u2019s own discipline.\n\n\nWhat is Geospatial Big Data Analytics?\n\n\nNo matter how sophisticated information technology gets, there is nothing that can replicate the combination of two unique pieces of data: time and place. Geospatial data come from a variety of sources, including sensors, GPS-enabled devices, volunteered geospatial data, and location-linked records and social media posts. Geographic information scientists and other geographers collect and use big data to analyze social and natural phenomena about our world.

Increasingly as students enter the workforce they will be challenged to not only interact with diverse populations, but will also have to understand the way diverse populations are impacted by a range of economic, political, and environmental challenges. They will also need to be exposed to ethical frameworks that can be productively leveraged within non-academic environments. Students who undertake a JEDIS certificate will take courses across the broad spectrum of human geography and will cultivate the intellectual capacity to address issues of inequality and diversity from an ethically informed perspective.\n \nLearning objectives: recognize and respect diverse experiences and perspectives; apply ethical frameworks to challenging economic, political, and environmental challenges; and think critically about the multiple implications of human choices and practices.\n\n\nWhat is Justice, Ethics, Diversity in Space?\n\n\nThe discipline of geography draws from a range of perspectives including traditions in the natural and social sciences as well as humanities. Questions of justice, (in)equality, and diversity across space are core to what human and environment-society geographers study. The Justice, Ethics and Diversity In Space certificate specifically addresses how geographers approach questions concerning uneven power relations, inequalities, justice, social responsibility, and ethics across space and in place; it is more focused than the complementary Human Geography and Environment-Society Geography certificates. Students will learn about different ethical frameworks that can be productively leveraged in the workplace. As a result, students will be prepared to manage and work in diverse settings and to think critically about their position in society.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou care about issues of diversity, ethics, and social justice and wish to understand how geographers explore these challenges in local to global contexts.\n\n\nYou want to learn about diverse cultures, environmental racism, immigration, and assimilation experiences of marginalized groups.\n\n\nYou would like to become knowledgeable of people\u2019s biases based on race, ethnicity, culture, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, social and economic status, political ideology, and disability, and how these contribute to discrimination and oppression.",

Students will take two foundational courses (\nHUM\u00a0101\n and \nHUM\u00a0102\n) where they will engage with transformative texts from the humanities and gain a foundation for understanding how their college and professional careers will benefit from the core skills and knowledge taught in the humanities. Students will take an additional two courses in one certificate pathway. Pathways and connected courses will be designated by each participating campus.\n \nAt the heart of many current problems and their solutions are the core skills and knowledge students learn in the humanities, from critical and analytic engagements with human values, worldviews, and culture, to abilities of self-expression. A grounding in the humanities provided in this certificate will help students understand how issues of intersectionality, history, interculturalism, global perspectives, democratic and ethical decision making, and many other areas fundamental to a humanities education will make them better citizens at work and in their local, national, and global communities, regardless of college major.\n \nThe certificate prepares students for the high-tech global economy that demands agile and flexible thinkers and actors who will amplify the specialized knowledge of their majors with a deeper, broader, and more complex understanding of how their disciplinary majors and future careers impact, or are impacted by, humanity.\n\n\nWhat is the Keystone Certificate for Integrative Humanities?\n\n\nThe Keystone Certificate is a 12-credit certificate program focused on core skills and knowledge in the humanities (for example: critical and analytical thinking; interpersonal and cultural competencies; and effective oral and written communication). Students take two gateway courses (\nHUM\u00a0101\n and \nHUM\u00a0102\n) and two elective courses from a specified pathway to complete the certificate. The program is designed so that most students will able to earn the certificate without having to take additional courses outside of their general education requirements.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are looking for a certificate in the core skills and knowledge that are highly sought after by employers and in advanced degree programs. It is especially useful for students in non-humanities majors in STEM and Business. In a competitive job market, setting yourself apart from other graduates is important. The certificate gives students an edge over other graduates because they will be able to talk about the intersections between their career and humanity, especially how what they produce impacts humanity and how the tendencies of humans should impact decisions related to innovation and creativity. In addition, they can talk about going into depth theoretically and having more practice that others in the core skills and knowledge most in-demand by employers (e.g., oral and written communication, collaborative skills, technological literacy, having a global perspective, ethics, leadership, problem-solving, critical thinking, and an understanding of the importance diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging philosophically as well as to the \"bottom line\").\n\n\nIf you start the certificate early enough, you can easily complete it as part of your general education requirements.",

Landscape-level management also increasingly depends on an understanding of coupled natural-human systems, and landscape ecologists need to be trained to understand interdisciplinary linkages between social and ecological sciences, which is a strength in geographic thought. This 12-credit certificate provides training necessary to make inferences about ecological dynamics at landscape scales through training in spatial analysis, environmental modeling, and geographically relevant ecosystem processes. Learning objectives: apply techniques of spatial analysis and environmental modeling to complex socio-ecological landscape systems, draw from social and ecological sciences to address challenges in coupled natural-human systems, and apply these tools for landscape- level management of human-environment processes.\n\n\nWhat is Landscape Ecology?\n\n\nLandscape ecology is a key focus within the physical and environment-society subdisciplines of geography. Geographers focusing on landscape ecology use field studies, models, and laboratory activities to measure, quantify, and forecast how ecosystems change across space and time. They work at scales ranging from microbial to sub-continental. Through such geographic analyses, landscape ecologists seek to understand how natural and human disturbances (such as fire or suburban development) influence landscape sustainability, and they make recommendations for managing the landscape. Landscape-level management increasingly depends on an understanding of coupled natural-human systems, and landscape ecologists need to be trained to understand interdisciplinary linkages between social and ecological sciences. The certificate in Landscape Ecology is more focused than the complementary Physical Geography and Environment-Society certificates, and it incorporates training in geospatial technologies.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are curious about how demand for more commodities and services from global ecosystems has led to an ecological crisis.\n\n\nYou want to study how climate change affects spatial distribution of plant species or the frequency of wildfires.\n\n\nYou want to learn about the role of people on landscape patterns and processes ranging from wilderness to cities.\n\n\nYou want to apply techniques of spatial analysis and environmental modeling to address challenges in complex human-natural systems.",

This 12-credit certificate prepares students to read future socio-economic trends, which will be of interest to many employers. This certificate prepares students for careers in community and economic development, urban design, politics, and travel and tourism through the study of human geography. Global understandings of population growth and international migration; the consequences of economic development; and the impacts of technological innovation are some of the topics covered in the courses that comprise this certificate. Additionally, students gain proficiency in identifying how political power and control of culture can impact human rights, and race and gender equality. Learning Objectives: Describe, analyze, and locate human relations and movements across and through space and place; recognize and discuss the geographical dimensions of varying social, cultural, political, historical, and economic conditions; and identify and analyze human use and/or human change of their environments locally, regionally and globally.\n\n\nWhat is Landscapes: Societies, Cultures, and Political Economies?\n\n\nHuman geographers examine human societies and how their cultures, economies and politics develop within the context of their environment. A geographic lens allows human geographers to critically examine the intersections of these social processes and how they shape the lived and built environment. Human geographers examine topics like how race shapes the way we interact in public spaces, how gender conditions where and how people find jobs, what the links are between global finance and community activism, how immigration is shaped by family connections, and why gerrymandering political districts can change the way we think about our neighbors. Human geographers look at how these social processes construct the contexts we live in and how these contexts vary in our increasingly globalized world.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to understand why location matters to people everywhere, every day.\n\n\nYou are interested in agricultural land use, industrial development, and urban design.\n\n\nYou are curious about the reasons for population growth and international migration.\n\n\nYou want to learn about the costs of economic development.\n\n\nYou are interested in how struggles over political power and control of territory deepen inequalities between peoples and places.",

Through this course series, nurses gain foundational forensics knowledge and skills, including evidence collection and preservation; forensic documentation; recognition of domestic violence, assault, and stalking; related public policy and regulatory guidelines; and legal and ethical issues. This program prepares nurses to provide care that is more specialized for victims and perpetrators of physical, psychological, and social violence or abuse.\n\n\nWhat is Nursing Forensics?\n\n\nViolence impacts our communities at a local, national, and global level. It\u2019s an unfortunate reality that a high number of patients who access healthcare services are the victims of violence, abuse, or neglect. When these victims enter the healthcare system, professionals trained in forensic nursing are often their first line of defense. In addition to providing routine medical care, forensic nurses must understand the legal and ethical implications of treating victims of violence and abuse. Forensic nurses must be skilled at injury identification, evaluation, and documentation. Proper observation, collection, and preservation of evidence is often critical in determining the legal outcome of traumatic events. Penn State\u2019s Nursing Forensics certificate provides nurses with the knowledge and skills to effectively help these patients.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are interested in working with victims who have experienced violence or trauma. Forensic nurses are vital in bridging the gap between medical care and the legal system. Students will learn to identify signs of violence, understand the resources and interventions available to help, and provide compassionate care while preserving physical evidence that may assist in criminal investigations. Enrollment in this certificate allows Nursing students to gain an additional area of concentration while pursuing their degree. This certificate introduces forensic nursing and may serve as a starting point for \nSANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) certification\n.",

Students who complete this 15-credit certificate will be trained dialogue facilitators: they will have an understanding of the forces that shape human communication on the interpersonal, societal, and global levels, and they will be able to apply this understanding by leading small group dialogues, applying a unique communication methodology developed by WinC over two decades. WinC is a laboratory for the sociological study of small groups and facilitation techniques that make communication across borders possible. As such, the study of facilitated dialogue that a student undertakes at WinC is truly \"applied sociology\"\u2014because sociological concepts practically intersect with and shape communication technologies. The combination of mindset and skills that a facilitator develops as a result of this fusion of disciplines is what makes impossible conversations possible. While students at WinC are trained in the specific academic context of applied sociology, trained facilitators are necessary in all environments in which human beings conflict and collaborate. As such, the competencies developed through this certificate are relevant across all academic disciplines. This certificate will prepare students to take on key roles in high level decision-making in education, politics, business, or law.

Intended for counselors, educators, family therapists, social workers and other professionals dedicated to serving the developmental needs of youth in contemporary society, the program provides an overview of the major issues that impact youth development from a social justice perspective.\n\n\nWhat is Youth Development and Social Justice?\n\n\nThe Youth Development and Social Justice (YDSJ) program focuses on the promotion of positive youth development within the context of social justice. The YDSJ framework views young people as assets and active change agents with the capacity to transform their lives and the world toward equity and justice.\n\n\nThe program provides an overview of the interconnectedness between youth development and youth resistance to social injustice. Students in the YDSJ minor will: 1) analyze issues of equity and oppression in relation to youth development, 2) work directly with youth in the community, and 3) apply theory to practice to build on the strengths of communities and youth. The program is experiential in nature and students learn by doing in trainings, workshops, and community settings.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in youth empowerment and social change.\n\n\nYou want to study big questions, such as such as: 'what does equitable education look like?' and 'how does youth organizing translate to social policy?'.\n\n\nYou want to make a difference in the lives of youth and communities.\n\n\nYou want to learn about the impacts of discrimination and oppression on youth development.\n\n\nYou want to pursue a career in behavioral health, social work, education, advocacy, nonprofit administration, community development, public policy, community organizing, or criminal justice.",
