Data Sciences integrate aspects of Computer Science, Informatics, and Statistics to yield powerful data science methods, systems, tools, and best practices that find applications across a broad range of application domains. The curriculum for the major is designed to equip students with the knowledge and the skills needed to elicit, formulate, and solve data sciences problems using modern data science methods, tools, and best practices for data management, data exploration, data integration, predictive modeling (using machine learning), and effectively communicate their findings to, and collaborate with a broad range of stakeholders. The students will gain the critical analytical skills needed to assess the feasibility, benefits, effectiveness, limitations, risks, and ethical implications of applying data sciences methods in different settings. Experiences such as the capstone project prepare students to function effectively as members of interdisciplinary data science teams to harness the potential of data to enable discovery, optimize products and processes, and inform decisions. As distinct from majors that focus primarily on developing data science knowledge and skills to support inquiry in other domains, the primary focus of the Data Sciences major is on the development, evaluation, application, and validation of the data science tools themselves. All students in the major receive in-depth training in data sciences through a set of core courses. Additionally, data sciences students specialize in one of the following options: applied, computational, or statistical modeling data sciences, as described below.\n \nApplied Data Sciences (DATSC_BS)\n \nOnly available through the College of Information Sciences and Technology\n \nThe students in the Applied DS option will receive exposure to an application domain so they are equipped to formulate and solve data science problems drawn from the chosen domain, e.g., life and health sciences, business, behavioral and cognitive sciences, physical sciences, agricultural sciences, among others.\n \nComputational Data Sciences (DTSCE_BS)\n \nOnly available through the College of Engineering\n \nThe students in the Computational DS option will receive additional training in Computer Science to be able to design, analyze, implement, and deploy advanced algorithms, hardware and software architectures, and systems for data management and analyses.\n \nStatistical Modeling Data Sciences (DTSCS_BS)\n \nOnly available through the Eberly College of Science\n \nThe students in the Statistical modeling DS option will receive additional training in Statistics to be able to formulate, develop, and apply the proper statistical models and methods for data analyses, e.g., experiment design, sampling, hypotheses testing, and limiting false discovery.\n\n\nWhat is Data Sciences?\n\n\nData Sciences is a field that explores the methods, systems, and processes used to extract knowledge from data and turn these insights into discoveries, decisions, and actions. The emergence of massive amounts of data \u2013 also known as \u201cbig data\u201d \u2013 found in our world through healthcare records, human sensors, digital media, and a number of other sources has increased the need for individuals who can obtain useful knowledge from big data and apply it to address major societal challenges across a variety of fields. Students pursuing this degree will develop the knowledge and skills needed to manage and analyze large-scale, unstructured data to address an expanding range of problems in industry, government, and academia.\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT DATA SCIENCES\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are curious about analyzing information to discover new insights.\n\n\nYou want to apply data analytics to make strategic decisions.\n\n\nYou want to understand how data can be used to visualize phenomena using AI and data science techniques.\n\n\nYou are interested in statistics, mathematics, and the social sciences, and want to combine these disciplines to understand what data is really telling us.\n\n\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHY STUDENTS CHOOSE TO STUDY DATA SCIENCES",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology (B.S. EMET) degree program provides the basic undergraduate education required for a career as an electro-mechanical engineer. The program emphasizes a breadth of knowledge in all fields of engineering technology related to typical, highly-automated manufacturing, production, or assembly plant processes. Basic coverage is provided in all major areas to technology involved in the operation and control of manufacturing and production processes, including instrumentation and monitoring methods, principles of machine design, automated control techniques, thermal and fluid sciences, computerized manufacturing systems, principles of electrical and electronic circuit operation, computer-aided drafting and design, economics of production, and statistical analysis and quality control.\n \nThe primary aim of the EMET program is to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills necessary to apply current methods and technology to the development, design, operation, and management of electro-mechanical systems, particularly in those industries where automated systems are prevalent.\n \nThe major is organized as a four-year baccalaureate program with the corresponding Penn State admission requirements. Graduates of an associate degree in either electrical or mechanical engineering technology from Penn State may re-enroll in the EMET program. The College of Engineering ENGR students may enroll through \"Change of Major\" procedures. Students from an engineering technology program at another institution or community college accredited by TAC of ABET may transfer into the program with advanced standing.\n\n\nWhat is Electro-Mechanical Engineering?\n\n\nThe Bachelor of Science degree in Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology responds to a growing demand for engineers with a broad range of technical skills. The program emphasizes knowledge in the field of technology related to the design, maintenance, and operation of electromechanical systems, essentially automation and robotics. These systems incorporate electronic, mechanical, instrumentation and control elements. The program provides students with hands-on experience with these elements, technical knowledge, and the soft skills needed to be successful in the field of engineering. In this curriculum, students receive early exposure to technology by scheduling technical courses in the major. A laboratory component that promotes the understanding of the subject matter through the experiential application of theory accompanies most technical courses. This program culminates with a senior capstone project in which students work together in a team to design and implement an engineering project from initial proposal through product demonstration.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are interested in math and science but prefer spending time applying your skills in a laboratory or field setting as opposed to studying the theory behind these subjects in a classroom setting. If you like to take things apart, to see how they work, this may be for you. There is a greater emphasis on engineering applications while building an understanding of scientific theory.",

Engineering Mechanics consists of Statics (bodies in equilibrium), Dynamics (bodies in unsteady motion such as vibration, moving on curvilinear paths) and the Mechanics of Deformable Media. The latter topic covers the change in dimensions of bodies of various shapes under the influence of forces, torques, temperature, and dynamic motion. Further failure criteria under such loadings are introduced and utilized in examples of engineering design. Some twenty undergraduate courses covering the above topics are available at two levels, i.e. sophomore introductory and senior (400) courses.\n\n\nWhat is Engineering Mechanics?\n\n\nEngineering mechanics is the engineering science that deals with the effects of forces and torques on particles, rigid bodies, or deformable media. Mechanics is typically subdivided into statics, dynamics, and mechanics of deformable bodies. The Engineering Mechanics minor is for undergraduates who wish to supplement their engineering backgrounds with extensive study in mechanics. The high-tech industry has a significant need for individuals with a sound background in engineering mechanics. Industries such as aerospace, automotive, power, structures, and appliance regularly hire graduates who are competent in engineering mechanics.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou wish to wish to supplement your engineering background with extensive study in mechanics.\n\n\nYou enjoyed your introductory courses in Statics, Dynamics, and Mechanics of Materials and would like to learn more.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe role of Information Sciences and Technology in the practice of Aerospace Engineering is very important. Aerospace systems rely heavily on computers, software, and digital information; for control, sensors, and other onboard systems. The Boeing 777 has more than 1000 processors and roughly 20 million lines of software onboard, and F-16 and F-117As cannot fly without their onboard computers. In addition, many future aerospace vehicles will be unmanned, and the software challenges will be even greater. The onboard memory has also increased exponentially, the F-106 had 20 KBytes of memory and the new Joint Strike Fighter might have 2 GBytes of memory. The hardware and software must be carefully designed and thoroughly tested, since most aerospace systems are mission- or safety-critical systems. Computers and software are heavily used in the design, development, and manufacturing of aerospace systems. Large supercomputers are often used in the design process. The IST minor will enrich their educational achievements and increase their chances in obtaining employment or entering graduate school. The NSF and the DOD are encouraging universities to enhance their educational programs so that we have well-qualified engineers for future systems, and our IPAC members have stressed the importance of IT for our students.\n\n\nWhat is Information Sciences and Technology for Aerospace Engineering?\n\n\nThe role of software in the practice of aerospace engineering is critical and continues to grow rapidly. The effective design, development, and manufacturing of aerospace systems rely heavily on computers, software, and digital information. Some aircraft cannot fly without their onboard computers, and many future aerospace vehicles will be unmanned, resulting in even greater software challenges. Providing undergraduate aerospace engineering students the opportunity to learn more about information sciences and technology by earning a minor in Information Sciences and Technology will not only enrich their educational achievements, but it will also make them more valuable to potential employers, and help them succeed in professional employment or graduate school. They will better appreciate the entire aerospace system better, and will be better equipped to work side-by-side with experts in the computing and software fields.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in learning more about the role of software in the practice of aerospace engineering.\n\n\nYou want to better appreciate the entire aerospace system, and be better equipped to work side-by-side with experts in the computing and software fields.",

The technical part of the curriculum, emphasizes nuclear power engineering, which refers to complex systems used to generate electricity. Because of our strong educational and research emphasis in nuclear power engineering, and because a shortage for this expertise exists in the industry, generally the industry values our graduates highly. We recognize that nuclear science, including nuclear security and non-proliferation, is an important growth area. We constantly assess and review the needs of our undergraduate students and their most frequent employers and use this feedback to consider revisions to our curriculum so that it is responsive to the needs of our constituents.\n \nThe first two years of the program stress fundamentals in mathematics, chemistry, physics, computer programming, and engineering sciences such as mechanics, materials, and thermodynamics. The last two years provide the breadth and depth in nuclear science, behavior of heat and fluids, reactor theory and engineering, and radiation measurement. The laboratory work includes experiments using the University's 1,000-kilowatt research reactor. Engineering design is incorporated in many courses from the freshman year to the senior year, but is particularly emphasized in the senior capstone design course, which integrates the critical elements of reactor theory, reactor engineering, safety considerations and economic optimization into a reactor design.\n \nMany graduates are employed by electric power companies that use nuclear power plants, or by companies that help service and maintain those plants. They use their knowledge of engineering principles, radioactive decay, interactions of radiation with matter, and nuclear reactor behavior to help assure that the power plants meet the demand for reliable, economic electricity while ensuring a safe environment. To do this, graduates must be problem solvers who can develop and use complex computer models and sophisticated monitoring systems, design systems to handle radioactive waste, determine if the materials in the plant are becoming brittle or corroded, or manage the fuel in the reactor to get the maximum energy from it. Other graduates work in industries that use radioactivity or radiation to detect problems or monitor processes. Jobs are also found in branches of the government as designers of the next generation of reactors for submarines, aircraft carriers, or space probes, or to manage and clean up contaminated wastes. They could also be involved with regulation of nuclear power or radiation uses, or in research to develop advanced technologies that will be used in next-generation power plants.
