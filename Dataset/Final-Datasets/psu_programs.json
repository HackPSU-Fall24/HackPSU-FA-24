        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThis major is designed to provide a balance of theory, research, and practice. The course sequence provides professional skills courses in conjunction with applied theory and critical evaluative courses. Students develop an understanding of the role and effect of advertising and public relations within the business, social, and political arenas. Students develop abilities and skills that prepare them for a wide range of professional opportunities that include: media planning and relations, research, and client services. Analytical abilities are equally stressed throughout the curriculum. Critical thinking skills, creative problem-solving, and the need to justify decisions are developed. Theory and practice from a wide range of disciplines including business, behavioral sciences, and applied statistics are used to equip the students to make informed decisions in a dynamic environment.\n \nAn important aspect of the program is the examination of the ethical implications of strategic communication practices used in the marketing, advertising and public relations arena. Students will develop a framework that will help them to understand and evaluate supporters and critics of strategic communications practices.\n \nAdvertising Option\n \nAvailable at the following campuses: University Park\n \nAll courses in the advertising option emphasize the critical importance of integrated communication. The objective of the curriculum is to prepare students for entry-level opportunities in the advertising profession and to prepare for eventual managerial roles where an understanding of integrated communication concepts is essential.\n \nThe program reflects an integrated marketing communications approach to the design implementation and evaluation of advertising messages. In addition to mastering the core professional courses, students are expected to have an understanding of the convergence of mass communication theory and practice and are encouraged to select from courses in communication theory, communication law, mass media history, ethics, and the impact of advertising and public relations on society.\n \nPublic Relations Option\n \nAvailable at the following campuses: University Park\n \nThe public relations curriculum prepares students for the challenges of public relations practice in a highly competitive, technological, multicultural, and global environment. In their course of study, students study the role and function of public relations in building cooperative mutually beneficial relations between organizations and their constituent publics through understanding, credibility, and trust.\n \nStudents complete a core set of courses that includes news writing, introduction to public relations, public relations methods, mass communication research, and public relations problems (campaigns).\n \nBecause of the critical importance of journalistic writing skills and an understanding of news media ethics, public relations majors are encouraged to take additional journalism courses to fulfill their communication electives.\n \nAdvertising and public relations students are encouraged to choose a minor from outside the Bellisario College of Communications. The majority of majors select minors in business, English, sociology, psychology, political science, information systems and statistical analysis, world language, and speech communication.\n\n\nWhat is Advertising and Public Relations?\n\n\nIn general, advertising and public relations are similar because the goal is sharing a message with an audience. At its simplest, advertising typically relies on paid messages to sell a product and public relations typically uses unpaid channels to sell an idea. Students who major in advertising/public relations at Penn State have a wealth of opportunities thanks to a degree that allows them to build on many of the same core skills before focusing on the advertising or public relations track. In each area, students can combine classroom instruction with hands-on work through partnerships or real-life client projects. Advertising students learn the art of persuasive storytelling via multiple mediums and how advertising affects mass media and how consumers are influenced by ads. Public relations students gain an understanding of brand building, research, and strategic planning to position a message to make an impact through various channels.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou're creative, curious and like sharing ideas and information with others.\n\n\nYou like to write and talk, or if you\u2019re comfortable with social media, advertising/public relations will play to your strengths.\n\n\n\n\nDesign, digital storytelling, and video skills are also valuable in the field as professionals regularly utilize a variety of tools to do their jobs. In addition, the field thrives on collaboration but also allows room for self-directed workers to succeed.\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT ADVERTISING/PUBLIC RELATIONS",

This minor is designed for students interested in African American culture and the educational, social, political, and economic development of people of African descent in the United States. In particular, it provides students with the opportunity to explore the experiences of African Americans using theories and methods originating in the field. Students are made aware of the potential to apply such knowledge to the solution of social, political, and economic problems. The minor also promotes greater understanding of the relationship between African Americans and other ethnic groups.\n\n\nWhat is African American Studies?\n\n\nAfrican American Studies is an intellectual field of inquiry that examines the history of people of African descent from the colonial period through the present; how systems of racial inequality are produced through state policy, traditional western scholarly disciplines, and popular discourse; and the social, political and cultural movements that black people have developed to identify and resist the unequal material and political conditions that shape black social life in the African Diaspora. The undergraduate major and minor provides a strong foundation in the key theoretical concepts in the discipline, the historical formation of African American Studies as an interdisciplinary field of study, and prepares students to apply what they have learned in the classroom, in independent research and in internships with social justice/service organizations.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are passionate about learning more about the history, cultures, and political struggles of people of African-descent in the West.\n\n\nYou are interested in understanding how racism operates structurally and shapes the social experiences and life chances of black communities.\n\n\nYou want to study social, cultural, and political movements throughout the African Diaspora.\n\n\nYou are interested in pursuing independent research or internships with non-profit, research, and community-based organizations committed to racial equity and social justice.",

Students are encouraged to do research and evaluate the relationship between the political, social, and economic developments in Africa and the African Diaspora. Two options are available within the major and are described here.\n \nAfrican American Studies Option\n \nThis option provides students with the opportunity to explore the experiences of African Americans using theories and methods originating in the field along with those adopted from the various disciplines. Students are also made aware of the potential to apply knowledge to discern better approaches for solving social, political, and economic problems. The curriculum also promotes greater understanding of the relationship between African American and other ethnic groups in the shaping of American society and culture.\n \nFocus Areas\n \nThe African American Studies Option has three focus areas, which are described below.\n \n \nHistory Perspective:\n While stressing the interdisciplinary nature of the field, this focus allows students to concentrate on the historical experience of the African Americans, including their political, social, and economic relations with other ethnic groups, as well as the shifting historical contexts in which they have contested and shaped the evolution of American society.\n \nSocial Sciences and Community Development:\n This focus area allows students to concentrate on contemporary political and economic experiences of African Americans as well as on public policy issues that pertain to the economic, political, and social engagement of African Americans in the search for equality in American society.\n \nCultural and Gender Perspective:\n This focus area allows students to concentrate on culture and gender in historical and contemporary terms.\n \n \nAfrican Studies Option\n \nThis option provides students with the opportunity to examine the geographical, cultural, historical, political, and economic aspects of Africa.\n \nFocus Areas\n \nThis option has two focus areas as described below.\n \n \nHumanities Perspective:\n This focus area enables students to concentrate on the history and culture of African societies and the evolution of Africa in world history.\n \nSocial Science Perspective:\n This focus area enables students to concentrate on political and economic developments, including state building and ethnic relations, development strategies, and Africa's position in the global system.\n \n \nLaw and Social Justice Option\n \nThis multi-disciplinary program would provide students with the opportunity to study the politics, culture, economics, and history of African Americans in our society and link this understanding with an in depth study of criminal justice and the legal system. Issues that students will focus on will be areas such as, Are African Americans discriminated against in criminal justice decision-making? What is the historic connection between race and punishment in the US legal system? How do issues of class, race and gender impact policy decisions about crime and punishment? What is the socioeconomic impact of high incarceration rates on the African American community? The program is designed to encourage students to think systematically about the relationship among public policy, the criminal justice system, and shifting notions of social justice that have characterized debates over the workings and goals of the prison system in American life and thought.",

Students majoring in Art History cannot take this minor.\n\n\nWhat is Art History?\n\n\nArt history is the exploration of art and architecture from pre-historic to contemporary times, in Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. It's museum studies, historiography, iconography, art criticism, connoisseurship, and research. It's studying aesthetics, and the context, form, and social significance of art throughout time and place. Art history relates visual images back to questions of religion, politics, society, gender, economics, philosophy, and culture.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are fascinated by art, architecture, and visual materials from prehistoric times to the present.\n\n\nVisual images make your mind light up with a hundred questions that all relate to \u201cWho? Where? When? How?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't wait to get to the business of answering these questions, then art history might be the minor for you!",

The program combines a broad exposure to the arts with significant training in management, marketing, event planning, strategic planning, writing, development, and digital communication.\n \nThe interdisciplinary Arts Administration program answers the growing need for leaders and administrators of arts organizations that must compete, survive, and thrive in a corporate world. Recognizing that these organizations have missions that are different from business corporations, the Arts Administration program aims to produce capable arts administrators, managers, and entrepreneurs with both aesthetic sensibilities and business acumen. Successful arts administration is crucial to the continued vitality of modern cultural institutions, creative enterprises, and arts organizations. If the public is to benefit, skilled arts administrators must facilitate the work of artists to realize their artistic vision and share it with the public, by executing the necessary financial, legal, and organizational decisions. In short, talented arts administrators are partners in a collaborative artistic process. The major includes the following options:\n \nDigital Media Option\n \nAvailable at the following campuses: Lehigh Valley\n \nEmphasizes design and social media engagement, so that a student may create and manage online content for cultural organizations.

Where does therapy end and enhancement begin? Do we have a right to choose the time and means of our own death\u2014and should medical personnel be permitted to assist us? Do we have a right to health care? Should governments to try to influence our food choices in order to promote public health, and counter the influence of advertising and marketing by food companies? What can we learn from the COVID-19 pandemic about addressing systemic racism and structural injustice? These are the kinds of questions we explore in bioethics using philosophy, art, fiction, film \u2026 and much, much more.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in health care ethics, food ethics, and environmental ethics.\n\n\nYou want fresh perspectives on ethical issues, new and old\u2014from the genetic modification of our food to the genetic modification of ourselves!\n\n\nYou want to be part of animated discussions about pressing issues that affect humanity.\n\n\nYou are studying philosophy, gender and sexuality, public or global health, health administration, anthropology, biobehavioral health, nursing, health communication, etc.\n\n\nYou are premed or prelaw; or you intend to pursue a career in medicine, law, health care, public health, veterinary science, biological sciences, environmental sciences, bioinformatics, or public policy\u2014among many other areas.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThis major helps prepare students for careers involving the application of engineering principles to agricultural and biological production systems, processing systems, and conservation of land and water resources. Education in mathematics, physics, and engineering sciences common to all engineering disciplines is provided along with specialized training in biological and agricultural sciences. The curriculum covers all areas of biological engineering, including development of machines for biological processing and agriculture, postharvest handling and processing, natural resource management and utilization, biological processes, food engineering, and structures and their environmental modifications. A student must select the Agricultural Engineering option, Food and Biological Processing Engineering option, or the Natural Resources Engineering option.\n \nPrinciples of engineering design experiences are integrated throughout the third-year curriculum by having students solve problems typical of those encountered in the agricultural and biological engineering profession. A year-long major design experience in the fourth year emphasizes that biological engineers must learn not only how to develop engineering solutions to unique, practical problems using the newest technology, but also to assess and integrate the social and ethical implications of their solutions.\n \nCareers for graduates include design, development, and research engineering positions involving biological processes, machinery development, natural resources management, materials handling, biological product development, and structural systems for animals, plants, and crop storage. Biological engineers are employed in industry, consulting firms, and governmental agencies in the United States and abroad. Graduates deal with the various engineering aspects associated with production and processing of food, fiber, and other biological materials, within the constraints of environmental protection and natural resource conservation.\n\n\nWhat is Biological Engineering?\n\n\nBiological Engineering involves the study of engineering fundamentals, very similar to traditional engineering disciplines like chemical, civil, or mechanical engineering. What makes Biological Engineering unique is the integration of these engineering fundamentals with biological, agricultural, and environmental sciences and the holistic approach taken to studying agricultural production, processing of food and other bio-based materials, and natural resource protection. Problem-solving skills are developed and then applied to grand engineering challenges such as sustainably providing safe food and clean water.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou enjoy quantitative problem solving and working with your hands and/or working outdoors.\n\n\nYou are interested in a career where you address challenges related to fundamental societal needs, like food, water, fiber, and renewable energy.\n\n\nYou are passionate about sustainability.\n\n\nYou want to take application-focused classes with interactive labs and hands-on learning opportunities.",

Since the early sixteenth century, when Europe, the Americas, and Africa were brought into a pattern of sustained interaction following the onset of the Age of European Discovery, the African slave trade and other forms of migration and exchange have been critical to the formative experience of Africans and African-descent populations linked by the Atlantic. The intensity and impact of those exchanges have varied over time, but the presence of Africans and African-descent populations in the evolution of Atlantic civilization constitutes the core of the study of the African Diaspora.",

In particular, the minor serves to encourage, recognize, and systematize student participation in public service or problem-based fieldwork and research that:\n \n \nis substantial, sustained, and includes structured opportunities for student reflection and critical assessment; and\n \nis integrated with and supported by traditional, classroom-based coursework.\n \n \nSpecifically, the minor consists of one prescribed course, Foundations of Civic and Community Engagement (\nCAS 222N\n or \nCIVCM 211N\n or \nAYFCE 211N\n), a supervised fieldwork experience, and supporting coursework selected with the advice and consent of a faculty minor adviser. The minor culminates with an approved capstone project, which may be a significant paper, or annotated portfolio, or other demonstration of substantial assessment and integration of the minor experience and the broader issue of application of academic theory and practice in the civic community. Capstones may be composed and delivered for academic audiences or as public scholarship -- or as some combination of the two -- depending on a student's professional and civic goals.\n The completion of the minor is reflected by a formal notation of the student's official record at the time of graduation. To enter the program, a student must submit an application at \nhttps://civcm.psu.edu/requirements-how-to-apply\n.\n\n\nWhat is Civic and Community Engagement?\n\n\nThe Intercollege Minor in Civic and Community Engagement provides an opportunity for students to extend their education beyond the classroom through engagement in socially meaningful public scholarship in both pre-existing and newly developing community projects. This minor entails situated as well as experiential learning. Students apply, test, analyze and re-formulate academic material in the context of public problems and community settings. Engaging in \"learning-by-doing\" allows students to communicate across differences, deliberate public problems, fulfill civic responsibilities, gain insight into personal values and world-views, develop civic skills including observation and listening, and further develop career interests and professional goals.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe program in Civil and Environmental Engineering is designed to provide the basic undergraduate education required for private practice and public service in civil engineering and/or continue formal education. Emphasis is placed on the fundamentals of civil engineering principles and design techniques. Students utilize basic engineering science concepts in several of the different specialty areas (e.g., construction/management, environmental, materials/pavement design/geotechnical, structures, transportation, and water resources). Finally the students are able to choose an area of specialization for professional practice or graduate studies.\n \nThe program is broadened by courses in communication, arts, humanities, social and behavioral sciences, as well as other engineering disciplines. Students gain experience in working as members of a team and using interdisciplinary approaches to solve problems. These experiences, as well as those related to engineering principles and design, are provided through exercises in the classroom, laboratory, and field. The program culmination is a capstone design course wherein the students' knowledge and skills are applied to actual engineering problems.\n\n\nWhat is Civil Engineering?\n\n\nCivil engineering is one of the oldest and most socially-relevant engineering disciplines. Grounded in mathematics and science, civil engineers make a lasting impact as they plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain the everyday, yet critical, infrastructure systems needed in our daily lives. In this challenging and diverse field, civil engineers also find solutions for critical environmental issues, including slowing the progress and mitigating the effects of climate change, eliminating the causes and treating the effects of environmental pollutants, and providing access to clean water. In recent years, the rapid application of new technologies has fostered the development of autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, smart structures, advanced materials, and new forms of renewable energy.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to design and build large-scale projects that last a long time.\n\n\nYou care about the quality of the water that comes out of the faucet.\n\n\nYou are interested in the operations and safety of future transportation systems.\n\n\nYou try to find sustainable solutions for every challenge, big or small.\n\n\nYou would like to use your technical skills in an exciting, people-serving profession.",

The ability to adapt to a rapidly changing social and business environment can yield great rewards and returns, but it requires innovative, multifunctional individuals able to adapt to and develop new technologies, innovations and businesses amid a wider environment of change, uncertainty and ambiguity. The major is conceived for students interested in starting and managing new businesses or innovating within existing business with the intent of growing the economy and providing jobs for a diverse workforce. The major focuses on developing problem solving and creative thinking skills, along with the ability to recognize opportunities, spot trends, and develop a plan to capitalize on these ideas. Emerging entrepreneurs and innovative managers of small to large businesses must be competent in various mediums of communication, have good negotiation skills, can lead with ethics and integrity, and are grounded in business aspects of planning, capital investing, goal setting, and decision making.\n\n\nWhat is Corporate Innovation and Entrepreneurship?\n\n\nMost people understand the concept of entrepreneurship \u2013 starting and running a new venture or small business. Corporate innovation, however, may not be as clear. The corporate innovation component of the CIENT major focuses on opportunities within the consulting industry as well as new product development and innovation within an existing company. The cornerstone of corporate innovation is the ability to identify opportunities and use corporate resources to implement change. An example can be a well-known chocolate company that initiated printing pictures on small pieces of candy which then opened up a whole new market segment for the company. Think creative ways to breathe life into existing product lines, or taking advantage of technology to lead a division into new business offerings or new business segments. CIENT embraces the mindset to continually look for new opportunities within an entrepreneurial context and a corporate environment. \n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT CORPORATE INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) in Digital Arts and Media Design (DART) is a multidisciplinary digital arts and design undergraduate degree in the College of Arts and Architecture\u2019s School of Visual Arts. Digital Arts and Media Design approaches design through the lens of the visual arts, as a critical, creative, and experimental studio-based practice. The major prepares students to become leaders in digital media fields where their commanding knowledge of emerging technologies allows them to contribute and innovate in creative media design careers.\n \nStudents\u2019 progress through a series of core courses in which they develop research, design, and computational skills to enhance their capacity for critical thinking. In addition to these core experiences, students hone creative thinking capabilities in a range of studio-based digital art and design courses. In the final year of study, students work rigorously on a senior thesis project based on topics of personal interests and areas of intensive study in the digital arts. A purpose of the thesis is to prepare students to meet the varying challenges they will face as digital art and design professionals.\n \nStudents may choose from one of three primary tracks in the program:\n \n \nDigital Art and Digital Design Emphasis: In this track students create individualized 2d-3d digital arts and design learning paths that may include UX/UI design (user experience/user interface), visual concept art and design, 3d modeling and digital fabrication, 2d-3d digital imaging and computer graphics, as well as the most recent emerging forms of digital art and design.\n \nInteractive Media Emphasis: In this track students create individualized learning paths for interactive media design. Students learn computational skills as visual thinkers, designing increasingly complex interactive experiences individually and in teams. Students take courses in game art, game design, physical computing, mobile and web design, virtual worlds, interactive media design, data visualization and cultural analytics.\n \nTime Based Media Emphasis: In this track students create individualized learning paths for 2d and 3d time based digital arts and media design including motion graphics, animation, computer graphics and pre-visualization as well as video compositing.\n \n\n\nWhat is Digital Arts and Media Design?\n\n\nDigital Arts and Media Design uses digital arts technologies in studio-lab settings to challenge young artists and designers to expand their ideas as they explore new languages of visual expression and communication. Following familiar studio ways of thinking and making traditionally associated with practices such as mixing pigments in painting, or shaping clay in ceramics, digital artists manipulate computer software through coding to expand the potential for creating new forms of image making. In an electronic environment, the single work of art may be replaced by multiple copies that are cloned and reworked using a range of image-making systems. Digital artworks may be exhibited in a variety of forms, such as digital prints, computer printouts, or other hard copy formats of any scale where each translation offers different interpretations. Digital art may also be encountered through networks, interactive games, simulations, or as immersive environments that require active participation by a viewer.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYour curiosity and creativity is stimulated by thinking visually in computer languages and graphic communication, and you are inspired by the thought that a digital device is a flexible and adaptive \u2018studio\u2019 space where you come up with your best ideas. You will plan and apply your creative design skills in a climate of invention and collaboration in interdisciplinary projects that explore changing visual technologies in art and design.",

In addition to the requirements of the student's major department, the minor consists of 18 credits selected from several colleges and departments. For those majoring in health care disciplines (e.g. speech and communication, psychology, special education, rehabilitation and human services, nursing and pre-med), a Disability Studies minor provides relevant interdisciplinary links that broaden exposure to conversations around disability beyond the clinical and administrative realms. For students in the humanities (e.g. history, philosophy, political science, and literature), Disability Studies offers important new dimensions of and challenges to dominant accounts of human value and political agency. For students with personal experience of disability and their allies, the minor provides an academic grounding and community for disability advocacy and intersectional activism on personal, community, and national levels.\n\n\nWhat is Disability Studies?\n\n\nThe minor includes courses on disability culture, activism, and history. It asks the following questions: what counts as \"normal\" and why? What are the racialized and class dimensions of \"ability\"? How do people with disabilities navigate a largely inaccessible world? What does disability look like on a global scale? What are the lived experiences of disability, and how are they central to American history and culture? How is disability coded by gender or sexuality? What is the value of learning about the lives and contributions of people with disability? How is disability related to environmental studies, bioethics, animal studies?\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in the engineering or architecture of built environments, health care professions, art and performance, social history, social justice activism, the political philosophy of citizenship, contemporary literature, legal studies, community advocacy, universal design.

Diversity Studies however tends to focus on our own lived experiences, and how our perception of these markers influences personal and cultural interactions \u2013 especially our own! It investigates systems of power that organize our schools, workplaces, healthcare systems, criminal justice system, and media, many of them invisible to us. Around the globe those systems of power are organized very differently, sometimes in fundamental ways. Diversity Studies approaches differences intersectionally to expose, critique, and confront historical and contemporary sources of social and cultural conflict.

One or more metropolitan areas in our increasingly crowded world will have experienced a devastating earthquake or volcanic eruption, sea level rise will be inundating low-lying coastal cities such as Jakarta along with whole island nations, energy resources will be less available and more expensive, and our climate will be warmer and characterized by more frequent extreme weather events.\n How we choose to plan for and attempt to mitigate these \"grand challenges\" will have consequences for individuals, nations, and our global socioeconomic and political systems.\n \nPersonal and collective actions are needed to ensure the sustainable use of our natural resources and environmental systems\u2014land, air, and water\u2014in an ethical and responsible manner. The United States needs to build robust educational pathways for its citizenry to develop the global perspective, cultural sensitivity, economic wisdom, and scientific acumen to inform their actions and address these grand challenges. The geosciences (marine, Earth, and atmospheric sciences) that explain the workings of the Earth system  provide critical insight into all of these challenges and, consequently, must be firmly integrated into those educational pathways. These programs seek to promote that integration through engaging the geoscience community and their colleagues in allied disciplines in the development of high-quality educational materials, and mechanisms by which these materials can be effectively brought to large numbers of students.\n \nThe goal of this minor is to dramatically increase geoscience literacy of undergraduate students, including   the large majority that do not major in the geosciences, and especially adult learners through the online program, such that they are better positioned to make sustainable decisions in their lives and as part of the broader society.\n\n\nWhat is Earth and Sustainability?\n\n\nThe Earth and Sustainability minor program is designed to provide students with the knowledge needed to make well-informed, environmentally sustainable decisions. It increases geoscience literacy and addresses key sustainability issues, such as the impact of climate change on Earth and its inhabitants, access to clean drinking water, sustainable energy, and the hazards posed by our overpopulated coastal regions.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are passionate about sustainability and the environment.\n\n\nYou want a better understanding of the science behind and potential effects of climate change.\n\n\nYou want to know more about the complexities, challenges, and opportunities involved in planning for the Earth's future.\n\n\nYou would like to explore both the scientific and the social aspects of big problems like population growth, resource management, and climate change.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nBy the time current undergraduates send their children to college, Earth's population will have increased to more than eight billion people. Our climate will be warmer and characterized by more frequent extreme weather events including droughts. One or more major metropolitan areas in our increasingly crowded world will have experienced a devastating hurricane or typhoon, sea level rise will be inundating low-lying coastal cities along with whole island nations, energy resources will be less available and more expensive, clean drinking water will be more scarce, and it will be increasingly difficult to feed the global population. How we choose to plan for and attempt to mitigate these \"grand challenges\" will have consequences for individuals, nations, and our global socioeconomic and political systems.\n \nThe goal of the 12-credit Certificate Program in Earth Sustainability is to dramatically increase geoscience literacy of all undergraduate students, including the large majority that do not major on the geosciences, future K-12 teachers, and also those who are historically underrepresented in the geosciences, such that they are better positioned to make sustainable decisions in their lives and as part of the broader society.\n\n\nWhat is Earth Sustainability?\n\n\nThe Earth Sustainability certificate program is designed to provide students with the knowledge needed to make well-informed, environmentally sustainable decisions. It increases geoscience literacy and addresses key sustainability issues, such as the impact of climate change on Earth and its inhabitants, access to clean drinking water, sustainable energy, and the hazards posed by our overpopulated coastal regions.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are passionate about sustainability and the environment.\n\n\nYou want a better understanding of the science behind and potential effects of climate change.\n\n\nYou want to know more about the complexities, challenges, and opportunities involved in planning for the Earth's future.\n\n\nYou would like to explore both the scientific and the social aspects of big problems like population growth, resource management, and climate change.",

The Earth Systems minor follows such an approach and offers undergraduates the opportunity to study the Earth as an integrated system. The Earth Systems minor is a science minor offered through the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. It provides a wider interdisciplinary perspective for majors in the traditional Earth science disciplines (geography, geoscience, and meteorology), and provides an introduction to Earth sciences and a broad exposure to Earth systems/environmental studies for other science and engineering majors. Students may apply up to 6 credits from courses in the major department to satisfy the minor requirements.\n\n\nWhat is Earth Systems?\n\n\nPursuing a minor in Earth Systems can help you build a better understanding of the complexly interwoven relationships within natural systems. Through this interdisciplinary minor, you will develop a comprehensive view of how Earth's systems\u2014the processes driving atmospheric, oceanic, and land changes\u2014interact with one another and how humans both affect and are affected by those processes. This minor would provide a useful complement to any student interested in environmental sciences, policy, or engineering.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to understand the big picture of how change happens to the Earth.\n\n\nYou are interested in the environment.\n\n\nYou like to contemplate the complexity of natural systems.",

Authenticity refers to developing professional and pedagogical skills in authentic classroom settings; for example, in the junior and senior years prior to student teaching, the program offers extensive field experiences in a variety of settings enrolling students with diverse backgrounds and needs. Reflectivity relates to consciously analyzing course content and one's own learning for the purpose of deeper understanding and self-improvement. Standards-based curriculum means that our candidates are steeped in Pennsylvania Academic Standards as well as the standards of relevant professional organizations. Taken together, these tenets enable our candidates to become\n lifelong reflective professionals committed to the learning of all students\n.\n \nStudents will choose one of four options for the degree:\n \n \nPK-4 Early Childhood Education,\n \nGrades 4-8 English/Language Arts and Reading,\n \nGrades 4-8 Mathematics, and\n \nGrades 4-8 Social Studies.\n \n \nUpon successful completion of this major, students will have met all of the requirements for either the Grades PK-4, Grades 4-8 English/Language Arts and Reading, Grades 4-8 Mathematics, or Grades 4-8 Social Studies Instructional I certification issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe Engineering Mechanics minor helps students prepare to analyze and/or design simple structures that are efficient and safe under foreseen loading conditions.\n \nContemporary engineering design of mechanical components requires precise information and modern analysis techniques to determine material response to anticipated loading. Designers must have the analytical and experimental tools to accurately define deformation under load to characterize dynamic response and to prevent mechanical failure. In the event of failure the cause(s) must be ascertained to prevent future failure through redesign and/or material substitution. Thus, industry has a real need for those with a sound foundation in Engineering Mechanics, the engineering science that deals with the effects of forces and torques on rigid and deformable bodies. Engineering Mechanics consists of Statics (bodies in equilibrium), Dynamics (bodies in unsteady motion such as vibration, moving on curvilinear paths) and the Mechanics of Deformable Media. The latter topic covers the change in dimensions of bodies of various shapes under the influence of forces, torques, temperature, and dynamic motion. Further failure criteria under such loadings are introduced and utilized in examples of engineering design. Some twenty undergraduate courses covering the above topics are available at two levels, i.e. sophomore introductory and senior (400) courses.\n\n\nWhat is Engineering Mechanics?\n\n\nEngineering mechanics is the engineering science that deals with the effects of forces and torques on particles, rigid bodies, or deformable media. Mechanics is typically subdivided into statics, dynamics, and mechanics of deformable bodies. The Engineering Mechanics minor is for undergraduates who wish to supplement their engineering backgrounds with extensive study in mechanics. The high-tech industry has a significant need for individuals with a sound background in engineering mechanics. Industries such as aerospace, automotive, power, structures, and appliance regularly hire graduates who are competent in engineering mechanics.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou wish to wish to supplement your engineering background with extensive study in mechanics.\n\n\nYou enjoyed your introductory courses in Statics, Dynamics, and Mechanics of Materials and would like to learn more.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nSkills attributed to entrepreneurial behavior and innovative thinking are beneficial for students in most if not all majors, and are critical to career success in established companies and new organizations to address pressing needs around the globe. This interdisciplinary minor uses problem-based learning and other active learning pedagogies to prepare students to create value and be agents of positive change in their discipline and their careers. The courses develop skills, knowledge and values in problem solving, innovation, opportunity recognition, self-efficacy, leadership, ethics, communications and learning from failure. To meet the students\u2019 broad range of entrepreneurship and innovation interests, core courses (9 credits) establish foundational knowledge, and then students select a concentration cluster aligned to specific contexts such as entrepreneurship in food and bio-innovation, technology, bio-tech, the arts, media, hospitality, digital, social entrepreneurship, advocacy or new ventures. Students who complete the ENTI minor will be better prepared to be innovation leaders in their chosen career path, such as being entrepreneurial in an existing company (intrapreneurship), engaging in a start-up venture full or part-time, finding avenues to leverage their art or craft, or creating alliances to meet social or business needs.\n \nAdvising for students in this minor and approval of curriculum exceptions will be available through the Entrepreneurship and Innovation (ENTI) adviser for each cluster.\n \nBio-Tech Cluster (Eberly College of Science)\n \nThis specialization prepares students to develop an entrepreneurial mindset and apply innovative strategies to find solutions that benefit humans, animals, and the environment. Students will also develop unique skills in career readiness such as teamwork, leadership and communication. Students who complete this cluster will be better able to take an interdisciplinary approach to solving problems through Biotechnology.\n \nDigital Entrepreneurship and Innovation Cluster (College of Information Sciences and Technology)\n \nThis specialization prepares a student to harness digital technologies and digital business models to develop their own concepts into commercial concerns or to contribute to the innovation activities of existing organizations (i.e., intrapreneurship). The IST Digital Entrepreneurship & Innovation cluster focuses on the impact of Information Technology (IT)-driven innovation across multiple industry sectors including for-profit, non-profit and governmental organizations. IT-driven innovation has created new business opportunities for both entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs and is key to increasing efficiencies and expanding the linkage between user-centric products and services. Students who complete this cluster will gain a foundational understanding of emerging information technologies, the components of digital business models, and implementation and design techniques that meet or exceed user-centric requirements.\n \nEntrepreneurship as Advocacy Cluster (College of the Liberal Arts)\n \nThis specialization empowers students to utilize the process of entrepreneurship as a form of advocacy to improve the human condition and enhance public life. The cluster leverages a critique of the business paradigm of \"maximize shareholder value\" to encourage students to create organizations that can be a force for positive change in society.\n \nFood and Bio-innovation Cluster (College of Agricultural Sciences)\n \nThis specialization will develop future entrepreneurs and innovators to address opportunities and challenges in the agriculture and life sciences space. The cluster focuses on the cornerstone challenge for agriculture: producing food for the world with entrepreneurial activity and innovation to develop, convert and use biological materials and natural resources (plants, animals, ecosystems and organisms, etc.) to meet the material and energy needs of society. Students are encouraged to take a series of courses in the cluster that complement their personal venture interests and engage in a series of immersive venturing experiences that can range from creating new ventures to mentoring with seasoned entrepreneurs or working within entrepreneurial organizations.\n \nHospitality Management Cluster (College of Health and Human Development)\n \nThis specialization prepares a student to create and develop novel but sound entrepreneurial concepts related to the hospitality industry in such businesses as lodging and food service. For example, through this cluster, students could develop and refine entrepreneurial concepts related to hotels, motels, bed & breakfasts, quick-service restaurants, upscale restaurants, mobile dining such as food trucks, on-line travel agencies, and other on-line ventures. The minor is also designed to prepare students to be innovators within existing organizations. Students who complete this cluster develop skills in creating business plans, feasibility studies, competitive analysis, supply and demand analysis, market analysis and financial forecasting. Students in this concentration are expected to include a mix of majors, not only students majoring in hospitality management.\n \nNew Media Cluster (College of Communications)\n \nThis specialization examines opportunities and challenges in the creation and distribution of news, entertainment and information. The same technological innovations that make it easy to start a media enterprise have introduced a host of editorial and business complexities. Media production and distribution skills and knowledge of media business, technologies, law and ethics are critical.\n \nNew Ventures Cluster (Smeal College of Business)\n \nThis specialization helps students develop the skills and ways of thinking required to create, develop, innovate and manage entrepreneurial companies.

Students understand and apply fundamental engineering design skills, product feasibility analysis and marketing techniques to move innovative products toward commercialization.\n \nSocial Entrepreneurship Cluster (College of Engineering)\n \nThis specialization focuses on creating sustainable social impact within marginalized communities. The cluster grounds students in social business, user-centered design for extreme affordability, systems thinking and scholarly research to develop innovative and appropriate technology-based solutions to address compelling global challenges. Travel and fieldwork in which students work in multidisciplinary teams to research, design, test, and commercialize ventures are required.\n\n\nWhat is Entrepreneurship and Innovation?\n\n\nEntrepreneurship and innovation is an interdisciplinary field that deals with new enterprise creation and the process of change and transformation in methods, ideas, and products. It is about problem-solving and the creation of value and positive change in business and society.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to learn what entrepreneurs do and how innovators create and solve problems in any field. Whatever you\u2019re majoring in or whatever career you\u2019ve chosen, entrepreneurs and innovators are there already making a positive difference. You can learn to be one, too.\n\n\nYou\u2019re passionate about starting your own business, non-profit, or social enterprise (entrepreneurship) or pursuing a career as an innovator within an existing firm or organization (intrapreneurship).\n\n\nYou want to learn the skills and develop the mindset of an entrepreneur and innovator.\n\n\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION",

This certificate is based on the twin foundations of this sub-field of geography, namely human-environment interactions and nature-society relations. Its purpose is to train students to use frameworks such as political ecology and environmental geography to provide the tools and concepts of change and sustainability necessary to analyze human-environment systems, environmental problems, and remediation across local-to-global scales, and the political economy of resource use and management.\n \nLearning objectives: Identify, describe, and analyze human-environment systems and processes across the globe; recognize how humans depend on, alter, and manage their environment in various places; and think critically about addressing complex human-environment challenges.\n\n\nWhat is Environment and Society Geography?\n\n\nEnvironment and society geography examines how human society and the natural world are interconnected. This certificate specifically addresses how geographers approach questions concerning human-environment relations, environmental processes, and environmental justice. Students who enroll in this certificate program will engage frameworks such as political ecology, environmental geography, sustainability, and globalization. Courses that contribute to this certificate cover topics such as conservation, agriculture, food, water, energy, climate change and health, as well as the complex ways these elements interact. Upon completing the certificate, students will be able to analyze human-environment systems, the political economy of resource use and management, environmental problems, and remediation across local-to-global scales. Focus areas include: conservation and protected areas; development; environmental health and inequality; urban-rural dynamics; food-energy-water nexus; and environment-society interactions involving agriculture, nutrition, and well-being.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in the complex interactions between environments and society.\n\n\nYou want to obtain the tools needed to address both the social and natural dimensions of environmental issues associated with health, sustainability, food scarcity, climate change, energy alternatives, water resources and urban and industrial growth.",

The minor is available to all undergraduates regularly enrolled in a degree program at the University. The objectives are to allow students to gain the multiple perspectives necessary for understanding environmental issues as well as to increase skills in collaborating with those from very different disciplinary backgrounds to find acceptable solutions. Students will be challenged to move beyond the channels of thinking characteristic of their own discipline to new ways of knowing, new sensitivities, and new analytical approaches. The program will engage students actively in learning experiences outside their major course of study. This minor is intended not to replace existing minors but to be a true intercollege, interdisciplinary minor.\n \nAdvising for students in this minor and approval of curriculum exceptions will be available through the Environmental Inquiry adviser designated within each participating college.\n\n\nWhat is Environmental Inquiry?\n\n\nThis interdisciplinary, intercollege minor can enrich all areas of academic study with essential, cross- disciplinary understanding of crucial environmental issues and how they are being framed and tackled from both scientific and policy perspectives. The minor\u2019s coursework can give students a greater appreciation of the environment, a broader understanding of environmental issues and problems, and insight into alternative methods of inquiry. If you have a background in science but also have ambitions to do something about the environment, you might find that a lot of the decisions about the environment are made in political settings. To have success in improving the environment will require you to speak the language of policy makers. The minor can help you on this track, exposing students to both the scientific background needed to understand environmental issues as well as the social science you need to promote these issues successfully.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in how the human impact on the environment is becoming increasingly relevant as population grows, resources are consumed, and businesses and industries become ever more productive.\n\n\nYou are interested in the complex debates that engage professionals from all fields. Now, more than ever, concerned agencies, organizations, and companies seek individuals knowledgeable about these important issues with experience communicating with people in professions outside of their own.\n\n\nYou want to be familiar with current environmental issues across all professional fields.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nIt is an interdisciplinary program with two options. One option is Environmental Systems Engineering and it is concerned with the impact of industrial activities on the environment and the choice of cost-effective remediation strategies. The other option is Environmental Health and Safety Engineering and it is concerned with safe and healthful design of industrial systems such that workers are protected from potentially high-risk exposures associated with today's industries. The program is unique as it is designed to address critical environmental, safety and health problems of the basic industries such as those involved in the extraction, conversion, and utilization of energy and mineral resources. The courses are sequenced so that students acquire an appropriate blend of theory, applications, and design and are equipped with the fundamentals necessary to maintain lifelong professional growth. Graduates are prepared to enter both the private and public sectors as environmental systems engineers or health and safety engineers or to pursue further education at the graduate level.\n \nDuring the first two years, the program shares many common features with other more traditional engineering disciplines. Students then take a series of special courses that introduce engineering concepts in the extractive and process industries. Process engineering and a variety of solid-solid, solid-fluid, and fluid-fluid separations play a major and often dominant role in the prevention and/or remediation of environmental damage or the prevention of health and safety hazards resulting from industrial activity. Students then specialize in the particular problems associated with air, land, or water; environmental health and safety engineering; or select a hybrid program. Specialization is accomplished through a combination of additional designated courses and selection from an extensive list of relevant elective courses. The curriculum is structured so as to integrate design concepts into the various subject areas covered in the program.\n \nThe human, societal, economic, ethical, and regulatory aspects of the industrial impact on the environment and on the workers themselves are addressed through a combination of specific courses and components of other more general courses. This aspect of the program is designed to provide students with a deeper understanding, both of the impact of environmental degradation on society and of the effects on industrial activity of society's demands for protection of workers and the environment. The program culminates with the capstone design course, which is an integrated, problem-based, multi-faceted project in which students, working in a team setting, utilize fundamental concepts to design an environmental remediation system or an environmental health and safety protection system (or incorporate these design requirements into other associated designs).\n\n\nWhat is Environmental Systems Engineering?\n\n\nProtecting the health of workers and the environment, often during challenging projects, is the job of an environmental systems engineer. They understand, demonstrate, and apply systems engineering principles to environmental issues related to industrial activities and to the extraction of energy and mineral resources. These engineers work closely with project leaders, utilizing process systems engineering and environmental systems approaches, to evaluate and address the environmental impact of projects.

The minor uses a competency-oriented approach to inform its curriculum, reflective interdisciplinary collaboration, and food systems stakeholder involvement.\n\n\nCompetencies and Guiding Principles of the Food Systems Minor\n\n\nA comprehensive ecology of knowledge framework emphasizes both what is taught, and how it is taught as mutually supportive components of education. The competencies of the minor are the what: the student learning objectives that graduates of the Food Systems minor are expected to demonstrate proficiency in. The guiding principles of the Food Systems minor are the how: they serve as a roadmap for how the courses and experiences in the minor will support the learning objectives.\n\n\nCompetencies\n\n\nStudents who complete the Food Systems Minor will:\n\n\n\n\nSolve complex problems: Analyze, plan, act on and evaluate solutions across multiple domains of the food system, including health, science, economics and business, community, agriculture, the food service industry, and policy.\n\n\nUse evidence from multiple ways of knowing (epistemologies) to analyze, select and assess food systems problems and solutions. Different knowledge include scientific, social, cultural, historical, political, indigenous, and local perspectives.\n\n\nRespect and critically reflect on one's own and others' perspectives and values to understand how these perspectives and values influence food systems decisions.\n\n\nBe civically engaged both locally and globally to enable positive change in food and agricultural systems.\n\n\n\n\nGuiding Principles\n\n\n\n\nExperiential learning. Courses and related activities will offer students place-based, learning experiences in food systems beyond the classroom, thereby integrating theoretical and practical knowledge. Activities will include engaged scholarship, internships, service learning, research, and other creative and professional work experiences. For example, the required Supervised Field Engagement Experience will provide opportunity for personalized work on food systems related topics, practice in stakeholder engagement, and network-building for students with potential future employers.\n\n\nInterdisciplinary problems and project-based learning. Problem-based learning, experiential and stakeholder-driven projects, and systems-oriented inquiry have been linked to positive student appraisal of competency development for individual courses (Galt et al. 2013). Courses and related experiences will incorporate pedagogies and curricula that emphasize students' engagement with interdisciplinary food system problem-posing (inquiry) and project-based learning, thereby placing students at the center of their learning.\n\n\nCommunity partnerships and engagement. Courses and related experiences will advance students' and community partners' knowledge, skills, and dispositions toward forming and maintaining partnerships in service towards food systems security and mutually beneficial community, health, and environmental sustainability goals.\n\n\nPersonal transformation through reflection. Courses and related experiences will provide opportunities for students, instructors, and allied partners to reflect (individually and collectively) upon their learning about a wide range of issues associated with environmental sustainability, economic development and community prosperity, justice and well-being with an intention to articulate change in one's own understandings.\n\n\nCollaboration and deliberation. Courses and related experiences will promote among students, instructors and allied partners opportunities to develop knowledge, skills and dispositions inherent to democratic/civic participation.\n\n\nCareer stakeholder engagement. Courses and related experiences will engage food systems stakeholders and prospective employers from government, industry and non-profit sectors. By assessing stakeholders' understandings of critical competencies for successful food systems work, Food Systems minor graduates will be better prepared to address current food system challenges and also achieve their personal and professional goals.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nGeobiology is the interdisciplinary study of the Earth and its biosphere. It embraces the history of life and its interactions with the Earth over geologic time; it also includes study of interactions between living organisms and physical and chemical processes in the modern environment on Earth, and possibly elsewhere in the universe. Thus, geobiology encompasses the fields of paleobiology and paleontology, biogeochemistry, geomicrobiology, and astrobiology. The degree program provides students with a strong background in general science and especially in geosciences and biology, with core selections from both disciplines. Students gain practical field experience in the study of the physical environment and ecological properties. The senior thesis provides students with hands-on research experience, as well as an emphasis on data synthesis and the written expression of scientific observations and ideas. Students will be well prepared for advanced studies in this emerging discipline, and for careers in the environmental sciences. Geobiology is critical to the study of environmental quality, global change, and environmental-human health interactions, all of which have profound importance in legal, economic, and policy arenas.\n\n\nWhat is Geobiology?\n\n\nGeobiology is the study of the interactions that occur between the biosphere (living organisms and their products) and the geosphere (solid part of the Earth). Geobiologists apply the principles and tools of biology to study the Earth and construct a picture of life through time. Geobiologists search for clues of how changes to the Earth in the past, such as periods of increased carbon dioxide or decreased temperature, have affected life on Earth and vice versa. By studying key aspects of the environment, geobiologists seek an understanding of how stressors affect entire populations, evolution, and extinctions. The study can involve field work such as collecting fossils or organic matter, or it can involve laboratory work using cutting-edge analytical instrumentation. By building a more detailed picture of how environmental changes affect life, geobiologists can help understand how predicted future environmental changes might impact life on Earth.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to understand the complexity of environmental factors that led to the origin and evolution of life on Earth and contributed to past mass extinctions.\n\n\nYou like to do field work outdoors, such as searching for fossils.\n\n\nYou are analytical and like to piece together clues to paint a picture of past life.\n\n\nYou like thinking about the big picture of evolution within Earth's geologic constraints.",

For students majoring in Geosciences, the completion of the minor will strengthen their physics/quantitative background and develop links between theory and application for these technical and quantitative skills. The minor will prepare students for graduate programs in geophysics and/or employment opportunities in the environmental and exploration industries.\n\n\nWhat is Geophysics?\n\n\nGeophysics is the application of physics to study of Earth (and other planetary bodies). The field is broadly focused on combining physics, mathematics, computation, and geology to investigate Earth\u2019s interior and dynamics, to understand and help mitigate natural hazards, and to explore for natural resources such as water, oil, gas, and minerals. \n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are curious about the mechanics of earthquakes, volcanism, and other natural hazards.\n\n\nYou are interested in the physical processes that drive plate tectonics.\n\n\nYou want to learn more about how geophysics is used to study the inaccessible parts of Earth (and other planets).\n\n\nYou would like to apply your physics, math, and computer skills to investigate natural hazards and/or to develop a broad understanding of how the Earth works.",

Geoscientists work to discover and develop natural resources such as groundwater, metals, and energy sources; to solve technology-generated environmental problems such as acid mine drainage and waste disposal; to predict geological events, such as the occurrence of earthquakes and volcanism; and to solve fundamental questions concerning the origin and evolution of Earth and life. The Bachelor of Arts degree program stresses data collection; investigation, analysis, and synthesis of information related to complex natural problems; rigor of thought; and clarity of oral and written expression. The B.A. provides a basic education in geosciences, and is designed for students who wish to prepare themselves for careers that interface among science, social science, and business. Examples of these careers include environmental law; national and international planning or resource management; and K-12 teaching.\n\n\nWhat is Geosciences?\n\n\nGeoscientists want to know more about the big picture of Earth and why it exists the way it does today. They investigate natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanoes, they explore life in extreme environments such as hydrothermal vents or in far-removed caves, and they examine processes such as water treatment and carbon cycling. This work involves understanding how geology, chemistry, physics, and biology intersect, both today and throughout the Earth's history. Geoscientists piece together a picture of both Earth's past environments and life throughout time. This can involve field work, laboratory work, or a combination.

Geospatial data derive from a rapidly expanding array of sources that include sensors (from satellites, to cameras and other sensing devices carried by UAVs, to distributed sensors monitoring energy consumption, pollution, traffic, and more with smart cities), GPS enabled devices (in vehicles, smart phones, cameras, human wearable devices, and even ones small enough to mount on migrating songbirds), citizen science efforts producing volunteered geospatial data, address-linked public health and many other records, retail transactions, and location-linked social media posts. As geospatial data become more ubiquitous, big digital geospatial data has become an essential part of geographic analysis. The 12-credit Geospatial Big Data Analytics certificate is aimed at students who are seeking advanced data collection, processing, analysis, and communication knowledge and skills related to leveraging the growing array of geographically linked big data. Courses for this certificate have prerequisites that are not included in requirements for the certificate; such prerequisites may be completed through the undergraduate Geographic Information Science certificate.\n \nLearning objectives: demonstrate an understanding of the breadth of methods and techniques available for handling large volumes of heterogeneous, rapidly-changing data; use multiple methods and techniques to conduct spatial analyses of big data and apply resulting analyses to problems within the student\u2019s own discipline.\n\n\nWhat is Geospatial Big Data Analytics?\n\n\nNo matter how sophisticated information technology gets, there is nothing that can replicate the combination of two unique pieces of data: time and place. Geospatial data come from a variety of sources, including sensors, GPS-enabled devices, volunteered geospatial data, and location-linked records and social media posts. Geographic information scientists and other geographers collect and use big data to analyze social and natural phenomena about our world. As geospatial data become more ubiquitous, big digital geospatial data has become an essential part of geographic analysis. Students enrolled in this certificate can learn how to collect, process, analyze, and communicate a wide range of geospatial big data.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in the use of big data to analyze spatial, social, and natural phenomena about our world.\n\n\nYou want to learn how spatial big data models aid in understanding logistics, finance, shipping, advertising, entertainment, and journalism.\n\n\nYou are curious about how big data can deliver much-needed context to decision making in many areas.\n\n\nYou want to know where and when people and things exist in the real world.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary B.A. degree in Global and International Studies is intended to prepare students for lives and careers in a world that is increasingly interdependent. It reflects a \u201cOne World\u201d concept that emphasizes the importance of global perspectives, international communication, and study or working experience abroad. The major combines the expertise of multiple disciplines, including the Social Sciences and the Humanities, to suggest a variety of methods for understanding the dynamic issues facing human beings across the globe. The structure of the major also recognizes the fact that the vast majority of the world's people live in regions other than the European and North American spheres, and that a knowledge of non-Anglophone cultures is an important form of preparation for global citizenship.\n \nThe major develops transnational and trans-regional literacy, drawing on coursework both in the Humanities and the Social Sciences to focus on questions of globalization, ethical imagination, and ways to engage peoples and cultures in local terms. Students learn to situate global trends, both macro and micro in nature, in relation to other historical processes. Most courses for the GLIS major will demonstrate a global or regional (rather than national) perspective and address a central topic in one of five designated Pathways.\n \nHuman Rights\n \nThis Pathway examines the history, development, enforcement, and violations of concepts of the basic rights of mankind. Whether through questions of torture, freedom of conscience, trafficking of women and children, agreements about prisoners of war, human rights constantly need redefining and rethinking if they are to be broad enough to cover everyone on our planet and specific enough to have a real effect on human behavior.\n \nCulture and Identity\n \nGlobal economic, political, and cultural processes are bound up with complex questions of culture and identity at the individual, familial, and community levels. Examining how differences in language, ideology, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation among others impact our sense of self and other, this Pathway considers:\n \n \nfoundational expressions of social and cultural values;\n \nthe formation and contestation of identity over time;\n \nthe impacts of modernization on individual, family, and community identity;\n \ngenetic manipulation and modification; and\n \nquestions of colonization and colonialism on political and cultural structures.\n \n \nGlobal Conflict\n \nThis Pathway examines war, peace, and security on a global and historical scale to reveal the contingent decisions, random accidents, and devious schemes which continue to be at the root of violence around the world. This Pathway studies conflicts great and small, from tribal warfare to national and international wars, revolutions, acts of terrorism, and so on. It also considers successful and unsuccessful efforts to halt conflict, and how and why approaches to and experiences with peace can affect conflict situations.\n \nWealth and Inequality\n \nThis Pathway considers global distribution of people, goods, and money, both in the contemporary world and in deep historical time, examining feudalism, trade, imperialism, nationalism, and the socioeconomic impacts of globalization. Some of the themes on which it focuses include:\n \n \nmotivations for and experiences of such human movement as migration, exploration, travel, slavery, diaspora, asylum, and exile;\n \ndemographic change;\n \npoverty, wealth, and economic inequality; and\n \npolitical, social, and cultural incentives for and restrictions on circulation (censorship, translation, free trade, prize culture, protectionism, access, privilege, bias).\n \n \nHealth and Environment\n \nThis Pathway considers the direct impact of global issues on the life on our planet. As intercontinental travel makes nearly every epidemic already global today, the more and more the health of individuals is directly connected to the health of the globe. Growing populations, aging demographics, increasing pollution, and decreasing food resources present new challenges for global human health. Similarly the global cycles of climate change and crisis force us to reconsider both natural processes and anthropogenic influences, examining the philosophy and history of human's place in nature. Some of the themes on which this Pathway focuses include:\n \n \nthe relationship between local resources and global geopolitics;\n \ncultural, economic, and social effects of global climate change;\n \npollution and conservation;\n \nenvironmental movements; and\n \nevolution and extinction.\n \n \nAlternatively, students with a GPA above 3.5 may work with advisers and faculty to create a personalized Pathway that reflects their interests.\n \nThe B.A. degree requires six credits of world-language study beyond the 12-credit proficiency level, or in a second world language.The B.A. degree may include a significant engaged scholarship experience (such as undertaking an internship, job, volunteer position, or period of study) located either abroad or in a majority non-English-speaking part of the United States.\n\n\nWhat is Global and International Studies?\n\n\nThe Global and International Studies (GLIS) Program is devoted to understanding human cultures and societies as bounded by \u201cOne World\u201d. The GLIS program emphasizes developing a global perspective through scholarly study, research, international communication and experience abroad. The GLIS Program brings together expertise from the Humanities and Social Sciences for an interdisciplinary approach to the global problems facing us.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are concerned about global problems that face everyone and cannot be explained by a single discipline or approach. Our majors and minors are engaged in thinking about the issues of planetary concern from Humanities and Social Science perspectives. If you think laws, economics, social statistics, history, and culture of importance in solving problems like war, starvation, mass migration, and climate change, think about GLIS.",

After completing an introductory course sequence (elementary classical Greek) that teaches students the vocabulary, morphology and syntax of classical Greek, students complete at least six credits in Greek language and literature at the 400-level for a total of 18 credits for the minor. In advanced courses in Greek language and literature, students gain analytical and interpretive skills by reading a wide range of classical Greek literature, including Greek drama, history, and philosophy, as well as the Greek New Testament. Students minoring in Greek will find their studies mesh well with a number of majors and graduate fields, including anthropology, archaeology, history, English, comparative literature, philosophy, and law.\n\n\nWhat is Greek?\n\n\n\u201cClassical Greek\u201d refers mainly to the Greek dialect spoken in Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE (Attic Greek). As such, Classical Greek was the language of the first great democratic state; eventually, it became the standard dialect that was read and studied for more than a thousand years down through the era of the Roman and Byzantine empires. After the Classical period, the Greek language continued to evolve, forming a standard common dialect (koine Greek) that was used throughout the Hellenistic world of the eastern Mediterranean and beyond. This was the dialect used by the writers of the New Testament to make it accessible to the widest literate audience. The modern Greek language is its descendant, though greatly changed after more than a thousand years of linguistic development.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou hope to analyze some of the world\u2019s greatest classical texts in their original language.\n\n\nYou want to pursue a career or engage in graduate studies in fields such as archaeology, theater, philosophy, literature, religious studies, law, and more.\n\n\nYou are interested in gaining further insight into the societies.",

It is best known as the language of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), which is a collection of books that were written between about 1200 BCE and 150 BCE. Following the Roman invasions into the biblical lands in the first two centuries CE, Hebrew fell out of use as a spoken language by around the 3rd century CE. It remained in use, however, as a literary and liturgical language among the Jews, and there is a huge corpus of Hebrew literature from that period, through medieval times, and into the modern era. In the late 19th century, Hebrew was revived as a spoken language, and today has about 5 million native speakers in Israel and abroad.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to be able to analyze classical Jewish texts in their original language.\n\n\nYou hope to further pursue an education and career in religious studies.\n\n\nYou have an interest in learning about Jewish culture in a more immersive way.",

Understanding basic mechanisms of immunity provides insights into how blood cells develop and how pathogens are recognized and attacked. Furthermore, understanding the concepts behind immunology is necessary for drug and vaccine design. Dysregulation of the processes that regulate immunity can contribute to uncontrolled inflammation, tissue destruction, autoimmunity, immunodeficiencies, leukemia and related cancers. Immunology includes a broad range of disciplines including but not limited to microbiology, virology, animal health, genetics, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology. Students enrolled in the Immunology and Infectious Disease Major will develop and understanding of normal immune responses to bacterial, fungal, and viral agents and appreciate the potential pathological outcomes of these responses. Students will learn about events that shape the immune response; the general biology of pathogens and the mechanisms by which they cause disease. In addition, basic skills in microbiology, molecular biology and biochemistry will be acquired. Students completing a B.S. degree in Immunology and Infectious Disease will be well prepared for veterinary, medical or other professional schools, Ph.D. graduate training in a wide variety of areas including immunology, microbiology, virology, molecular medicine, animal science, molecular biology and biochemistry or highly competitive jobs as research technicians, laboratory assistants or sales representatives with a pharmaceutical company.\n\n\nWhat is Immunology and Infectious Disease?\n\n\nImmunology and Infectious Disease is the study of how the body copes with bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, cancer, autoimmune disease and other diseases of the immune system.  The immune system protects us from infection through is a complex network of cells and tissues designed to fight invading pathogens.  Immunology is the study of the response of the immune system to bacterial, viral or parasitic infections.  It is also the study of diseases caused by disorders of the immune system. Autoimmune diseases are diseases that cause your immune system to attack your own body.  Immunodeficiency disease is a result of failure of the immune system to function in its normal capacity.  Allergy is a result of the immune system responding to substances that are not usually harmful.  Immunology also covers the development of the immune system as well as the malignant growth of immune cells, and the epidemiology of infectious disease.\n\n\nYou Might Like this Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in studying mechanisms of human disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and whole organism levels, and how these diseases are impacted by components of the immune system\n\n\nYou are looking for opportunities to perform research in the laboratories of faculty in areas of immune cell development, inflammation, autoimmune disease, cancer biology, and infectious disease",

Increasingly as students enter the workforce they will be challenged to not only interact with diverse populations, but will also have to understand the way diverse populations are impacted by a range of economic, political, and environmental challenges. They will also need to be exposed to ethical frameworks that can be productively leveraged within non-academic environments. Students who undertake a JEDIS certificate will take courses across the broad spectrum of human geography and will cultivate the intellectual capacity to address issues of inequality and diversity from an ethically informed perspective.\n \nLearning objectives: recognize and respect diverse experiences and perspectives; apply ethical frameworks to challenging economic, political, and environmental challenges; and think critically about the multiple implications of human choices and practices.\n\n\nWhat is Justice, Ethics, Diversity in Space?\n\n\nThe discipline of geography draws from a range of perspectives including traditions in the natural and social sciences as well as humanities. Questions of justice, (in)equality, and diversity across space are core to what human and environment-society geographers study. The Justice, Ethics and Diversity In Space certificate specifically addresses how geographers approach questions concerning uneven power relations, inequalities, justice, social responsibility, and ethics across space and in place; it is more focused than the complementary Human Geography and Environment-Society Geography certificates. Students will learn about different ethical frameworks that can be productively leveraged in the workplace. As a result, students will be prepared to manage and work in diverse settings and to think critically about their position in society.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou care about issues of diversity, ethics, and social justice and wish to understand how geographers explore these challenges in local to global contexts.\n\n\nYou want to learn about diverse cultures, environmental racism, immigration, and assimilation experiences of marginalized groups.\n\n\nYou would like to become knowledgeable of people\u2019s biases based on race, ethnicity, culture, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, social and economic status, political ideology, and disability, and how these contribute to discrimination and oppression.",

Students will take an additional two courses in one certificate pathway. Pathways and connected courses will be designated by each participating campus.\n \nAt the heart of many current problems and their solutions are the core skills and knowledge students learn in the humanities, from critical and analytic engagements with human values, worldviews, and culture, to abilities of self-expression. A grounding in the humanities provided in this certificate will help students understand how issues of intersectionality, history, interculturalism, global perspectives, democratic and ethical decision making, and many other areas fundamental to a humanities education will make them better citizens at work and in their local, national, and global communities, regardless of college major.\n \nThe certificate prepares students for the high-tech global economy that demands agile and flexible thinkers and actors who will amplify the specialized knowledge of their majors with a deeper, broader, and more complex understanding of how their disciplinary majors and future careers impact, or are impacted by, humanity.\n\n\nWhat is the Keystone Certificate for Integrative Humanities?\n\n\nThe Keystone Certificate is a 12-credit certificate program focused on core skills and knowledge in the humanities (for example: critical and analytical thinking; interpersonal and cultural competencies; and effective oral and written communication).

In addition, they can talk about going into depth theoretically and having more practice that others in the core skills and knowledge most in-demand by employers (e.g., oral and written communication, collaborative skills, technological literacy, having a global perspective, ethics, leadership, problem-solving, critical thinking, and an understanding of the importance diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging philosophically as well as to the \"bottom line\").\n\n\nIf you start the certificate early enough, you can easily complete it as part of your general education requirements.",

The Kinesiology major options are: Applied Exercise and Health; Movement Science; and Exercise Science. All options require a culminating practicum or research experience. Relocation away from the University Park campus is generally necessary for the practicum. All options require a minimum of 120 credits for graduation. Information about the major and its options can be found at: \nhttps://hhd.psu.edu/kines\n.\n \nApplied Exercise and Health Option\n \nAvailable at the following campuses: University Park\n \nThis option provides applied interdisciplinary training in the foundations of the scientific understanding of exercise and health through the lifespan. Students select one of two areas of emphasis that are certification-based and practice-oriented: (a) courses and practical experiences directed toward certification by organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) or the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), or (b) health and physical education; a series of courses and student teaching leading to teacher certification. The completion of the Applied Exercise and Health Option will prepare students to work in the private or corporate fitness arenas, community-based fitness organizations, and university or hospital settings, or be Pennsylvania certified in health and physical education (K-12) and secure teaching positions in public or private schools.\n \nMovement Science Option\n \nAvailable at the following campuses: Altoona, University Park\n \nThis option provides interdisciplinary scientific training in academic areas such as biomechanics, exercise physiology, movement neuroscience, psychology of physical activity, and sport history and philosophy to understand movement for prevention and diagnosis of chronic disease, rehabilitation and treatment, and/or theoretical study. Students are prepared for graduate study in many clinical fields including medicine, physical therapy, occupational therapy, physician assistant, cardiac rehabilitation, as well as a broad range of careers in biomedical and health-related fields.\n \nExercise Science Option\n \nAvailable at the following campuses: Altoona, Berks, Harrisburg\n \nThis option is a program of study in the science of exercise. This program offers Kinesiology background and applied experience in fitness assessment, exercise physiology, exercise psychology, motor skill development, nutrition, and healthy living skills. Graduates will be able to scientifically assess fitness levels of individuals. Analyzing those assessments, graduates will then be capable of designing and implementing appropriate exercise programs. Students \u200bin the Business Emphasis acquire basic business skills in accounting, marketing, management and entrepreneurial skills. Students choosing the Science Emphasis will select courses from a department list\u200b, including courses in basic science, social science, exercise and health sciences, and other related coursework, that will enhance their opportunity for graduate studies in fields related to Kinesiology and allied health, such as physical therapy\u200b, athletic training, and medicine. The completion of the Exercise Science Option will enable graduates to compete for employment in private, corporate, or community-based fitness organizations, in hospital or university settings, and be prepared to apply for graduate programs in allied health fields.\n\n\nWhat is Kinesiology?\n\n\nKinesiology refers to the study of human movement. This interdisciplinary field of study focuses on physical activity, movement and sport and includes specialized areas of study that include the arts, humanities, sciences and professional disciplines. These areas include biomechanics, psychology of physical activity, exercise physiology, history and philosophy of physical activity, motor development, as well as sports medicine and physical education pedagogy. This multi-disciplinary approach is useful for addressing health and wellness in a complex society.\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT KINESIOLOGY\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou enjoy working with people, have a passion for health and wellness, and are open to approaching problems with interdisciplinary strategies.

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nLandscape ecologists are in increasing demand in the areas of conservation management, urban planning, and Earth system science. Landscape-level management also increasingly depends on an understanding of coupled natural-human systems, and landscape ecologists need to be trained to understand interdisciplinary linkages between social and ecological sciences, which is a strength in geographic thought. This 12-credit certificate provides training necessary to make inferences about ecological dynamics at landscape scales through training in spatial analysis, environmental modeling, and geographically relevant ecosystem processes. Learning objectives: apply techniques of spatial analysis and environmental modeling to complex socio-ecological landscape systems, draw from social and ecological sciences to address challenges in coupled natural-human systems, and apply these tools for landscape- level management of human-environment processes.\n\n\nWhat is Landscape Ecology?\n\n\nLandscape ecology is a key focus within the physical and environment-society subdisciplines of geography. Geographers focusing on landscape ecology use field studies, models, and laboratory activities to measure, quantify, and forecast how ecosystems change across space and time. They work at scales ranging from microbial to sub-continental. Through such geographic analyses, landscape ecologists seek to understand how natural and human disturbances (such as fire or suburban development) influence landscape sustainability, and they make recommendations for managing the landscape. Landscape-level management increasingly depends on an understanding of coupled natural-human systems, and landscape ecologists need to be trained to understand interdisciplinary linkages between social and ecological sciences. The certificate in Landscape Ecology is more focused than the complementary Physical Geography and Environment-Society certificates, and it incorporates training in geospatial technologies.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are curious about how demand for more commodities and services from global ecosystems has led to an ecological crisis.\n\n\nYou want to study how climate change affects spatial distribution of plant species or the frequency of wildfires.\n\n\nYou want to learn about the role of people on landscape patterns and processes ranging from wilderness to cities.\n\n\nYou want to apply techniques of spatial analysis and environmental modeling to address challenges in complex human-natural systems.",

This 12-credit certificate prepares students to read future socio-economic trends, which will be of interest to many employers. This certificate prepares students for careers in community and economic development, urban design, politics, and travel and tourism through the study of human geography. Global understandings of population growth and international migration; the consequences of economic development; and the impacts of technological innovation are some of the topics covered in the courses that comprise this certificate. Additionally, students gain proficiency in identifying how political power and control of culture can impact human rights, and race and gender equality. Learning Objectives: Describe, analyze, and locate human relations and movements across and through space and place; recognize and discuss the geographical dimensions of varying social, cultural, political, historical, and economic conditions; and identify and analyze human use and/or human change of their environments locally, regionally and globally.\n\n\nWhat is Landscapes: Societies, Cultures, and Political Economies?\n\n\nHuman geographers examine human societies and how their cultures, economies and politics develop within the context of their environment. A geographic lens allows human geographers to critically examine the intersections of these social processes and how they shape the lived and built environment. Human geographers examine topics like how race shapes the way we interact in public spaces, how gender conditions where and how people find jobs, what the links are between global finance and community activism, how immigration is shaped by family connections, and why gerrymandering political districts can change the way we think about our neighbors. Human geographers look at how these social processes construct the contexts we live in and how these contexts vary in our increasingly globalized world.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to understand why location matters to people everywhere, every day.\n\n\nYou are interested in agricultural land use, industrial development, and urban design.\n\n\nYou are curious about the reasons for population growth and international migration.\n\n\nYou want to learn about the costs of economic development.\n\n\nYou are interested in how struggles over political power and control of territory deepen inequalities between peoples and places.",

Although the emphasis of Latina/o Studies is on the U.S., the role of Latina/o immigration within wider shifts related to globalization requires an understanding of Mexico, Central and South America, and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean.\n\n\nWhat is Latina and Latino Studies?\n\n\n Latina/o Studies is an interdisciplinary field that critically analyzes the local, national, and hemispheric importance of the Latino/s in the U.S. It draws from a variety of established disciplinary methods, including social sciences, history, and literary and cultural studies. It traces the birth and transformation of Latino communities within American society from the colonial period to the present. The field comparatively studies U.S. and Latin American contexts, and engages multilingual aspects of Latino culture. The field also studies the sociocultural experiences and cultural production of Latinas and Latinos. It serves as a bridge between the academic and non-academic worlds in order to understand the complexity of all the Latino national groups: scholars of the field often both document and engage with the struggles and political activism of Latino/as in their search for equality, representation, and social justice.

Laws structure the rights and responsibilities of citizens, the conduct of business, and the powers and obligations of governments. The minor in legal studies introduces students to a variety of perspectives on the law, its operation, and its effects in different contexts. Students take a core set of courses that examine how laws are made, how they are put into practice, and how they affect the broader world. They build on this foundation with coursework focused on specific aspects of law or areas of its application.\n \nThis minor is an excellent complement to the major field of study for students who are interested in the broad ways that law touches citizens\u2019 everyday lives as well as for students with more focused interests in the legal environment and consequences of their primary area of study. The program will be particularly valuable to students outside of the liberal arts who are interested in law. The array of courses from which students can choose to complete the minor makes the program compatible with a wide range of majors, including engineering, business, criminal justice, communication, environmental/resource management and sustainability, information technology, and intellectual property.\n \nThe Legal Studies minor requires 18 credits. 9 credits are required courses that provide a foundational understanding of various facets of the law, including the US legal system, the power and function of law as a social institution, and the sources and effects of change in legal orders. The remaining 9 credits are selected from a cross disciplinary list that enables students to focus their study of law in accordance with their interests and professional goals.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThis major would allow students to receive a BA degree in Linguistics. Linguistics, which is the study of language as a structural, cognitive, historical, and cultural phenomenon, intersects with many different academic disciplines and career paths. Linguists study how people acquire their knowledge of a language (or multiple languages), how this knowledge interacts with other cognitive processes, and how best to model this knowledge. They study how to represent the structure of the various aspects of language (such as sounds or meaning), how to account for different linguistic patterns theoretically, and how the different components of language interact with each other. Since every language is spoken across multiple communities of practice, linguists also study variation in language based on region, ethnicity, gender, or any number of other social factors. In order to learn about as many of the world's 7000 languages as possible, many linguists do fieldwork. This means that they work with speakers of little-studied languages to discover grammatical patterns and/or to document the language. Other linguists search databases (or corpora) of spoken and written language to find patterns there. Yet others run carefully-designed experiments with children and adults in schools, in the field, and in university labs. Linguistics is the scientific study of language in all its complexity.\n\n\nWhat is Linguistics?\n\n\nLinguistics is the scientific study of language: how it is structured, how it is acquired, how it is used to convey information, and how it changes over time. While many linguists do speak more than one language--or at least know how to approach the study of other languages--linguistics is much more than this. Through courses and a wide variety of research opportunities, our students explore how languages are structured (sentence structure, sound patterns, meaning and more), and how those structures are processed by the human brain. Since language is integral to all societies, linguists are interested in how language affects culture, and how social factors (place of birth, social class, ethnicity, gender, age, etc.) impact language use. We approach language from a global perspective, investigating commonalities and differences across languages in order to increase our understanding of what makes human communication unique.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou enjoy studying languages, particularly finding and applying linguistic patterns.\n\n\nYou are interested in communication, and learning more about the function of language(s) in society.\n\n\nYou like to think about how the human brain functions, and want to know more about language and cognition.\n\n\nYou like logic, computer programming, and/or abstract puzzles.",

Although Penn State does not award degrees in this field, a number of faculty pursue research interests in the marine sciences, and a varied selection of undergraduate courses in the marine sciences is available. The student can either complete the requirements for the minor at University Park (UP) or participate in an intensive semester-long oceanography experience at the Southampton, UK, Oceanography Centre (SOC) through education abroad:\n \nThe latter option may be of particular interest to students from non-UP locations. SOC has designed a program for PSU students that provides abundant opportunity to participate in shipboard oceanographic research, including a week of day-cruises in the spring and a 2-week series of cruises in June. Students who elect to pursue that minor at UP have the opportunity to receive training as scientific scuba divers through Penn State's Science Diving Program and participate in a number of other field experiences in the marine sciences.\n \nMARINE SCIENCES MINOR:\n The Marine Sciences Committee is authorized to award a minor certificate to any undergraduate student regularly enrolled in a degree program at the University who, in addition to satisfying the degree requirements of his or her baccalaureate major, satisfies the requirements for the Marine Sciences minor. The completion of the minor is reflected by a formal notation on the student's official record at the time of graduation.\n\n\nWhat is Marine Sciences?\n\n\nUndergraduate students in the marine science minor pursue their interests in the study of the oceans across a broad range of disciplines including marine biology/ecology, chemical oceanography/marine chemistry, marine geosciences, and meteorology. Marine Scientists often work at the interface of these disciplines to study the physical, chemical and biological processes that govern oceans and marine life from the scale of entire ocean basins to the fate of microscopic particles. Applications of this research range from food and energy security to defense. Penn State has a group of world-class faculty pursuing research interests from the coastal zones to the deep sea and from the tropics to the polar regions. An important goal of Penn State marine scientists is to study the impacts of global change and ocean exploration on marine ecosystems.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou have an interest in the oceans and marine life and are considering a career in marine science.\n\n\nYou enjoy laboratory and field-work and/or science diving.\n\n\nYou are interested in studying abroad.",

Mechanical engineers create things that help improve the health, happiness and safety of our everyday lives such as biomedical devices, aircraft and cars, and ways to store renewable energies. Mechanical engineering is divided into two broad areas: mechanical systems and thermal systems. Mechanical systems include the design of mechanisms and the analysis of the strength and wear of materials. Thermal systems include methods of energy conversions, heat transfer and fluid flow.\n\n\nWhat is Mechanical Engineering?\n\n\nMechanical engineering is the largest and broadest engineering discipline. It uses a combination of physics, chemistry, mathematics, and materials science to study mechanical, fluid, and thermal systems. Mechanical engineers are problem solvers: They use their foundational knowledge to apply scientific and engineering methods to the design, construction, and testing of products and components to ensure that they are safe, reliable, and cost effective. Mechanical engineering differs from mechanical engineering technology in that it emphasizes the math and science behind the theoretical development of engineering analysis and design process principles rather than the application of these principles. Mechanical engineers design everything from athletic equipment, medical devices, theme park rides, and personal computers to engines and power plants.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou think outside the box to develop solutions to everyday problems.

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nMeteorology and atmospheric science is a rigorous scientific discipline devoted to the attainment of an increased understanding of the atmosphere and the development of methods for applying that knowledge to practical problems. Although this field is usually associated with weather prediction, it also has significance in environmental, energy, agricultural, oceanic, and hydrological sciences. For students wishing to pursue many of these areas, the department offers several options within the major.\n \nThe major requires a solid foundation in mathematics and the physical sciences, and it provides a comprehensive survey of the fundamentals of atmospheric science. It has sufficient flexibility to permit intensive advanced study in such related areas as mathematics, Earth sciences, or engineering. The department has particular strengths in weather analysis and prediction, including forecast uncertainty and severe weather; physical meteorology, including radar meteorology, instrumentation and atmospheric measurements; and applied areas, including atmospheric diffusion, air pollution chemistry, dynamic meteorology, tropical meteorology, climate, weather risk, and remote sensing.\n \nGraduating meteorologists are prepared for professional employment with industry, private consulting firms, government, and the armed forces or for further study toward graduate degrees normally required for research, university, or management positions.\n \nThe first and second years are largely devoted to preparatory work in science, mathematics, and the liberal arts. The junior and senior years involve a core of basic courses in applied and theoretical topics and a choice of courses offering specialized training. The courses unique to each option are normally taken in the junior and senior years.\n \nAtmospheric Science Option\n \nThis option challenges students to strengthen and broaden their understanding of the physics and chemistry of both the atmosphere and oceans. It helps prepare them for employment in the diverse field of the atmospheric sciences and for graduate study in the atmospheric or related disciplines. Students are encouraged to participate in undergraduate research projects under the supervision of atmospheric and oceanic scientists in the department college.\n \nEnvironmental Meteorology Option\n \nEnvironmental Meteorology prepares the student for understanding the impact of the weather and climate on the environment, which is to say the impacts of air and water on natural and human-altered ecosystems. In order to do this, the option establishes links between atmospheric physics and a variety of environmental disciplines pertaining to land, water, soils, and plants. Depending on his/her interests, the student will select courses in Air Quality and Dispersion, Ecology, Environmental Chemistry, Geographic Information Systems, or Hydrology.\n \nGeneral Option\n \nThis option has sufficient flexibility to serve the needs of students who wish to pursue topics chosen broadly from subdisciplines of meteorology or from related areas in consultation with the academic adviser. The General option is appropriate both for students who intend to pursue postgraduate degrees and for students who want to emphasize a topic for which no option exists.\n \nWeather Forecasting and Communications Option\n \nThis option prepares students for careers in which their skills as weather forecasters are effectively used in a variety of ways, from science reporting and television broadcasting to web design and computer-based weather graphics production, and developing innovative applications of weather and climate data to industry.\n \nWeather Risk Management Option\n \nThe option combines study of meteorology and atmospheric sciences with training in risk, finance, and quantitative decision-making. Weather affects a wide range of industries, including energy, agriculture, insurance, construction, retail, and transport, among others. Weather and climate variation play central roles in the availability of water resources, the spread of disease, and an array of other processes vital for human welfare. There are, consequently, many organizations that confront risks related to weather, and that have a demand for experts who can help them manage these risks. The option in Weather Risk Management is designed for students who wish to work professionally at this intersection of meteorology and risk management.\n\n\nWhat is Meteorology and Atmospheric Science?\n\n\nMeteorology is one of the oldest of modern sciences. The word itself was coined by Aristotle more than 2,000 years ago for the first book on the science of \u201cthings lifted up.\u201d Meteorology and atmospheric science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific principles to explain, understand, observe, and forecast the behavior of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Meteorologists and atmospheric scientists explore the significance of weather and climate as it relates to the environmental, energy, agricultural, oceanic, and hydrological sciences. From severe weather, numerical weather prediction, and climate change to weather risk and air pollution\u2014there\u2019s no shortage of practical applications in meteorology and atmospheric science.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are interested in applying mathematics, physics, and computer programming to real-world problems.\n\n\nYou are fascinated with weather, climate, or the environment.\n\n\nYou are a self-described \"weather geek.\"\n\n\nYou would like to be a \u201cweather communicator\u201d such as a television meteorologist or science writer.\n\n\nYou want to study global warming and the Earth's changing climate.\n\n\nYou would like to work with data from satellites, radar, and other environmental sensors.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nMining contributes to nearly 15 percent of the U.S. and 25 percent of the global economy. Mined products are significant and critical inputs to food production, manufacturing, construction, and electricity supply, and each year every person in the U.S. requires an average of 38,500 pounds of new minerals to equip and power their day-to-day activities. Over 14,000 mines distributed throughout the U.S. supply the majority of these mined products.\n \nThe Penn State Mining Engineering program prepares students for a career in the industrial minerals, metals, and energy industries that sustain the domestic and global economies. Importantly, the program provides an emphasis on sustainable mining through integration of environmental health and safety, and societal responsibility principles in the design and operation of mineral enterprises.\n \nGraduates of the program will be prepared to work domestically or internationally to develop and operate mines; or to work in supporting activities including engineering consulting, banking, equipment development and supply, regulatory enforcement, and research. This is accomplished primarily through the curriculum, but is enhanced by an internship program, which allows qualified students to obtain practical experience through structured employment opportunities in the private and public sectors. \n \nThe curriculum is built on the foundation of mathematics, science, and general education common to engineering majors at Penn State. The courses specific to this major are designed and sequenced to provide an appropriate blend of theory, application, and design. The required courses help to provide the enabling skills for graduates to work in any facet of the vast minerals industry, and technical electives allow for in-depth study of more specialized topics. The general education opportunities are sufficiently broad and diverse in nature and scope to enable the student to tailor the educational experience to particular interests, backgrounds, and expected roles in society.\n \nStudent-Trainee Program\n \nAn internship program and a five-year work-study plan are available to incoming students in Mining Engineering. Numerous mining and manufacturing companies, as well as government agencies, cooperate with the University to offer structured employment opportunities during the student\u2019s academic career. In addition to earning significant funds to help finance their education, these opportunities provide valuable practical and professional experience prior to graduation. The internships normally take place in the summer, and the B.S. degree can be earned in four years. The work-study plan consists of alternating six-month periods of employment and schooling, and requires five years to earn the B.S. degree. Additional information can be obtained from the department.\n\n\nWhat is Mining Engineering?\n\n\nMining today means computer design and automation, surveying and monitoring with drones, developing and refining our resources for critical metals and fuels, improving health and safety, and promoting sustainability principles. The supply chain for transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, energy, and defense relies on mining. Mining engineers touch all aspects of resource recovery from mine planning through production through refining to final reclamation of mined lands. They are found in mines, processing plants, engineering consulting companies, and corporate board rooms. Their job may see them in the field one day and engrossed in plans and designs in an office the next. They put all their engineering skills to use.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to join a high-tech industry that provides metals, fuels and materials for every industry.\n\n\nYou want to face new opportunities and challenges every day.\n\n\nYou want to be a problem solver.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe overall educational objective of the Nuclear Engineering program is to help prepare our graduates to function effectively in the marketplace in a wide range of career paths in Nuclear Engineering. The technical part of the curriculum, emphasizes nuclear power engineering, which refers to complex systems used to generate electricity. Because of our strong educational and research emphasis in nuclear power engineering, and because a shortage for this expertise exists in the industry, generally the industry values our graduates highly. We recognize that nuclear science, including nuclear security and non-proliferation, is an important growth area. We constantly assess and review the needs of our undergraduate students and their most frequent employers and use this feedback to consider revisions to our curriculum so that it is responsive to the needs of our constituents.\n \nThe first two years of the program stress fundamentals in mathematics, chemistry, physics, computer programming, and engineering sciences such as mechanics, materials, and thermodynamics. The last two years provide the breadth and depth in nuclear science, behavior of heat and fluids, reactor theory and engineering, and radiation measurement. The laboratory work includes experiments using the University's 1,000-kilowatt research reactor. Engineering design is incorporated in many courses from the freshman year to the senior year, but is particularly emphasized in the senior capstone design course, which integrates the critical elements of reactor theory, reactor engineering, safety considerations and economic optimization into a reactor design.\n \nMany graduates are employed by electric power companies that use nuclear power plants, or by companies that help service and maintain those plants. They use their knowledge of engineering principles, radioactive decay, interactions of radiation with matter, and nuclear reactor behavior to help assure that the power plants meet the demand for reliable, economic electricity while ensuring a safe environment. To do this, graduates must be problem solvers who can develop and use complex computer models and sophisticated monitoring systems, design systems to handle radioactive waste, determine if the materials in the plant are becoming brittle or corroded, or manage the fuel in the reactor to get the maximum energy from it. Other graduates work in industries that use radioactivity or radiation to detect problems or monitor processes. Jobs are also found in branches of the government as designers of the next generation of reactors for submarines, aircraft carriers, or space probes, or to manage and clean up contaminated wastes. They could also be involved with regulation of nuclear power or radiation uses, or in research to develop advanced technologies that will be used in next-generation power plants. Graduates who want to further their education in the fields of health physics, radiation biology, or nuclear medical applications find this degree to be a useful preparation.\n\n\nWhat is Nuclear Engineering?\n\n\nNuclear Engineering is a multidisciplinary field that goes beyond providing nuclear power for electrical production. Nuclear engineers may apply their knowledge in various fields, including disease treatment, safeguarding food supplies, operate nuclear energy systems, develop regulations to ensure safety, or facilitate space exploration.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are interested in using basic science to make the world a better place for humankind through the production of clean energy, keeping the country safe from nuclear attack, and the application of nuclear science.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThis 12-credit certificate introduces students to forensic health sciences, forensic nursing, and the nursing role in the scientific investigation of violence. Through this course series, nurses gain foundational forensics knowledge and skills, including evidence collection and preservation; forensic documentation; recognition of domestic violence, assault, and stalking; related public policy and regulatory guidelines; and legal and ethical issues. This program prepares nurses to provide care that is more specialized for victims and perpetrators of physical, psychological, and social violence or abuse.\n\n\nWhat is Nursing Forensics?\n\n\nViolence impacts our communities at a local, national, and global level. It\u2019s an unfortunate reality that a high number of patients who access healthcare services are the victims of violence, abuse, or neglect. When these victims enter the healthcare system, professionals trained in forensic nursing are often their first line of defense. In addition to providing routine medical care, forensic nurses must understand the legal and ethical implications of treating victims of violence and abuse. Forensic nurses must be skilled at injury identification, evaluation, and documentation. Proper observation, collection, and preservation of evidence is often critical in determining the legal outcome of traumatic events. Penn State\u2019s Nursing Forensics certificate provides nurses with the knowledge and skills to effectively help these patients.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are interested in working with victims who have experienced violence or trauma. Forensic nurses are vital in bridging the gap between medical care and the legal system. Students will learn to identify signs of violence, understand the resources and interventions available to help, and provide compassionate care while preserving physical evidence that may assist in criminal investigations. Enrollment in this certificate allows Nursing students to gain an additional area of concentration while pursuing their degree. This certificate introduces forensic nursing and may serve as a starting point for \nSANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) certification\n.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe Associate in Science in Occupational Therapy Assistant Program prepares students to work in numerous practice settings, guided by the supervision of occupational therapists. Across the lifespan, individuals engage in meaningful occupations. Learning, playing, working, resting, and caring for self and others are among the occupations of life. A physical or psychological challenge may hinder an individual, group, and/or community from participating fully in meaningful occupations. Occupational therapy makes it possible for people to maintain or reclaim independence; thereby positively engaging in Living Life to its Fullest\u2122. Upon successful graduation from the program, students must sit for and successfully pass the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT) national certification examination to practice. Most states also require licensure as a condition for employment. A felony conviction may affect a graduate's ability to sit for the NBCOT certification examination and obtain licensure. NBCOT may be contacted at:\n \nNBCOT\n One Bank Street\n Suite 300\n Gaithersburg, MD 20878\n 301-990-7979\n \nwww.NBCOT.org\n \nTo enter this major, students must have a high school diploma or its equivalent. To be admitted to degree candidacy, the applicant must have completed educational background requirements called Carnegie Units or Secondary School Units. Students are responsible for proof of liability insurance and other requirements specified by the facility providing supervised field experience.\n \nThe size of each entering class is limited so that optimal clinical experiences and practical application situations can be maintained. Students are expected to progress through the program in the prescribed manner. Fieldwork affiliations are maintained within a specified geographical area. Students may be required to make special housing and transportation arrangements during the fieldwork phase. Students must complete all Level II fieldwork within eighteen months of successful completion of OTA didactic course work. The 2OTCC and 2OTBL curricula are delivered in five semesters.\n\n\nWhat is Occupational Therapy?\n\n\nOccupational therapy is a practice informed by physical, psychological, and occupational science. It is with these skills and knowledge; occupational therapy assistants employ intervention plans that engage people in maintaining or reclaiming independence. A physical or psychological challenge may hinder an individual, group, and/or community from participating fully in meaningful occupations. When this occurs an occupational therapy assistant works with the client(s) to design a plan to Live Life to its Fullest\u2122. As a certified occupational therapy assistant, you will work in numerous practice settings, guided by the supervision of occupational therapists. Most importantly, by choosing a career in occupational therapy, you will be at the forefront in making a difference in people\u2019s lives by way of therapeutic use of self and an intentional relationship.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou want to work with individuals and groups across the lifespan. Occupational Therapy Assistants work in rehabilitation and acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, schools, community health centers, mental health facilities, pediatric specialty settings, and higher education, and can also create their own niches in a variety of settings. If you appreciate helping to solve problems and empower people, being an occupational therapy assistant may be the right fit for you!",
        "entrance_to_major": "Entrance to Major\n\n\nThe Occupational Therapy Assistant program admits students to begin in the fall semester.\n \nIncoming first-year and transfer students who meet the program and campus admission requirements are admitted directly into the major. For more information about the admission process for this major, please send a request to the campus undergraduate admission office or to the program contact (listed in the Contact tab of the Bulletin).\n \nFirst year students include those who have graduated from high school and have attempted fewer than 18 semester hours of college coursework at another college or university after high school graduation.\n \nThe minimum high school units required for admission to the Occupational Therapy Assistant program include four secondary units of English, two units of mathematics (including one unit of algebra), two units of science (one unit must be biology), and five units of arts, humanities, social studies, and/or foreign languages.\n \nAlthough the minimum high school GPA required for admission is a 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale), this does not guarantee admissions into the program. The program is competitive; therefore, applicants who submit their application to Penn State by December 31 will be reviewed on a space available basis.\n \nTransfer Applicants\n \nIn addition to a cumulative grade-point average, it is recommended that a transfer applicant should have demonstrated successful completion of at least three (3) credits of natural science with a lab and one (1) social science related course from another institution. These types of courses may include (but are not limited to) mammalian anatomy, physiology, chemistry, psychology, sociology, and other core biological, chemical, and social sciences. The admissions selection committee strives to select students who have demonstrated the potential to succeed in a rigorous, science-oriented program of study.\n \n*\nOT does not offer an advanced placement option for coursework for credit for experiential learning in the OTA program.\n*\nOT does not require prerequisite education or work-related experience for admission to the OTA program.\n \nChange of Major\n \nRequests will be considered for entrance into the OTP Program based on academic performance and space available in the OTA Program.\n \nStudents who wish to change their major must have a cumulative collegiate grade-point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale as the minimum University requirement for change of major consideration. In general, change of major to the Occupational Therapy Assistant program requires a substantially higher cumulative grade-point average. The number of qualified applicants typically exceeds the number of available program spaces; therefore, satisfaction of the minimum requirements does not guarantee approval for entrance to major.\n \nIn addition to a cumulative grade-point average, it is recommended that all change of major applicants should have demonstrated successful completion of at least one (1) laboratory based biological and one (1) social science related course prior to the January review:\n \nBiological and Life Sciences (one lecture and one lab)\n \n \nBIOL 161\n/\nBIOL 162\n: Anatomy & Physiology I\n \nBIOL 163\n/\nBIOL 164\n: Anatomy & Physiology II\n \n \nSocial and Behavioral Sciences (choose at least one)\n \n \nPSYCH 100\n: General Psychology\n \nHDFS 129\n: Introduction to Human Development and Family Studies or \nPSYCH 212\n \n\n\nAdditional Information\n\n\nStudents are responsible for proof of liability insurance and other requirements, including criminal background checks and health information specified by the facility providing supervised field experience.\n\n\nA felony conviction on record may impact a student's ability to sit for the certification examination administered by NBCOT after gradation; this can subsequently impact a graduate's ability to attain state licensure. Before applying to the OTA program, students can contact NBCOT for information on their early determination program to assess examination eligibility.

Graduates are prepared to enter both the private and public sectors as petroleum and natural gas engineers or to pursue further education at the graduate level.\n \nThe courses are structured to serve as a melting pot for theory, application to case studies, and engineering project design. This enables the student to appreciate and understand that a successful engineering design project requires a sound theoretical foundation, experimentation and engineering judgment. The thrust of the program structure emphasizes the fundamentals of mathematics and earth and engineering sciences and integrates them in application to traditional petroleum and natural gas engineering topics. Design projects are required throughout the curriculum. Execution of these projects requires an amalgamation of problem formulation strategies, testing of alternative design methodologies, feasibility studies, and economic and environmental considerations. Graduates of the program are expected to perform in various facets of the petroleum industry including drilling, production, evaluation, transportation, and storage. The petroleum and natural gas engineering faculty and staff are committed to an interactive teaching and learning environment to ensure that the student is an active participant in the learning process. General education opportunities are sufficiently broad and diverse in scope to enable the student to tailor the educational experience to particular interests, background, and expected role in society.\n\n\nWhat is Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering?\n\n\nPetroleum and Natural Gas Engineering is a field related to extracting hydrocarbon resources from subsurface reservoirs. This engineering discipline is about designing, implementing, and managing solutions for subsurface energy production and storage. Petroleum and natural gas engineers solve crucial problems related to one of the most important resources for society today: energy. They predominantly work in the upstream sector of the oil and energy industries, which comprises exploration, field development, well drilling, production and injection well optimization. Once oil and gas are discovered, petroleum engineers determine optimum drilling and completion methods, monitor and manage production operations, and design reservoir development strategies. They are responsible for providing engineering solutions with global economic, environmental, geopolitical, and societal impacts. They are well-suited to solve complex problems in geothermal energy, geological carbon sequestration, hydrogen and energy storage, wastewater disposal, and environmental remediation of soil, groundwater, and other geologic media.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou enjoy combining disciplines such as geology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics to solve complex problems of importance to society.\n\n\nYou want to use science and engineering principles to tackle the challenges of global energy demands.\n\n\nYou seek a profession that offers domestic and international networking opportunities.\n\n\nYou enjoy working in the field, performing sophisticated computer simulations, or interpreting geologic and production data.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe fields of pharmacology and toxicology are by nature interdisciplinary biomedical sciences, drawing upon the foundations and approaches of cell biology, systems physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. A primary objective of pharmacology is to investigate fundamental aspects of cellular and molecular regulatory mechanisms for the purpose of understanding how drugs act and in order to develop new drugs for treatment of disease. Toxicology examines how chemical agents produce adverse effects on the organism, and studies mechanisms by which these materials contribute to cancer, neurological diseases, metabolic disorders and many other diseases and conditions. Our program is truly unique. One of the only eight majors in toxicology and pharmacology in the United States, it is the only one that blends molecular/cellular and environmental studies of toxicology and pharmacology.\n\n\nWhat is Pharmacology & Toxicology?\n\n\nPharmacology and toxicology study two sides of the same coin namely how do chemicals affect organisms positively (Pharmacology) or negatively (Toxicology). Toxicology as the study of the adverse effects of chemical, physical, or biological agents on people, animals, and the environment. It complements the study of Pharmacology, which examines the beneficial effects of chemical and biological agents. Pharmacologists and Toxicologists are scientists trained to investigate, interpret, and communicate the nature of beneficial as well as hazardous effects of manmade chemicals. These are interdisciplinary sciences, integrating information from biology and virtually all its subspecialties (e.g., genetics, endocrinology and molecular biology) as well as math, physics, and chemistry and its subspecialties (e.g., analytical, organic, and clinical chemistry).\n\n\nYou Might Like this Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to translate detailed knowledge of biology and biochemistry into a form that benefits human and ecological health as well as policy decisions\n\n\nYou want to study how new drugs are discovered and evaluated for health benefit as well as potential toxic responses\n\n\nYou appreciate that human-made chemicals released into the environment impact the ecosystem and want to understand how you define and manage safety",

Students develop knowledge and skills in data collection and the appropriate use of equipment and exercise associated with various physical therapy treatment modalities. To accomplish these tasks, the major utilizes a combination of basic science and non-science course work coupled with courses specifically designed for the physical therapist assistant student. Students must progress through the program as prescribed by the suggested academic plan for their campus of admission. The program culminates with a full semester of clinical experience.\n \nThe size of each entering class is limited so that optimal clinical experiences and practical application situations can be maintained. Clinical affiliations are maintained over a wide geographical area, and students may be required to make special housing and transportation arrangements for the clinical phase. Prior to the beginning of the clinical experiences, PTA students are required to complete clinical requirements that may include, but are not limited to: health examination, immunizations, FBI fingerprint check, child abuse clearance, state background check and drug screening. Students will be responsible for completion and purchase of the necessary checks/clearances through a University approved vendor and providing results to the clinical sites.\n \nIn addition to a PTA certification/licensure, many state licensing boards and clinical facilities require a criminal background check, child abuse clearance, and a drug screening. Students with criminal records should contact the physical therapy licensing board in the state they plan to practice prior to applying for admission to the PTA Program to inquire about potential restrictions for licensure.\n\n\nWhat is a Physical Therapist Assistant?\n\n\nPhysical Therapist Assistants (PTAs) work as part of a team providing physical therapy services under the direction and supervision of a licensed physical therapist. PTAs implement interventions outlined in the physical therapist\u2019s plan of care, collect data related to interventions, and modify selected interventions to progress patients towards their individual goals. These goals are designed to reduce pain, restore function, improve mobility and prevent disability. An Associate in Science Degree in Physical Therapist Assistant requires 5-semesters of study, including three full-time clinical practicums. The PTA Program prepares graduates to take the national examination for certification/licensure as a PTA.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou are interested in working with people of all ages who have health-related conditions that cause pain or limit their ability to move or perform functional activities in their daily lives. PTAs work under the direction and supervision of a licensed physical therapist to provide meaningful interventions, such as exercise, training for walking and other activities, manual therapy and interventions, and the use of physical agents and electrotherapy.",

Students learn various frameworks for designing and evaluating governmental policies, along with tools to analyze the impact and effectiveness of those policies. The knowledge and skills cultivated by the minor are important to any citizen interested in how government can and does respond to collective problems, as well as to future leaders who strive to influence the policymaking process. The minor is particularly useful to students who are interested in applying the expertise they are developing in their major field of study to public debate, decisions, and administration, and to those aspiring to careers at the intersection of industry and government regulation.\n \nTo complete the minor, students take 9 credits of required courses that provide a foundational understanding of the public policy process; the political context of policy advocacy, debate, and decisions; and the predominant methods of policy analysis and evaluation. They build upon this core knowledge with a choice of 9 credits of introductory and upper level courses from Political Science and partner disciplines that focus on the policy process itself, the actors and institutions that are central to the policy process, and the development of specific policy areas.",

For the Portuguese Minor, students will need a minimum of 19 credits of Portuguese (at least 6 of which must be at the 400 level), with grades of C or better. Students will be able to select from a comprehensive list of courses that can count toward the Minor. Students are held to the requirements that are in effect when they officially declare the Minor. They can take more than the minimum 19 credits if they so desire; there is no penalty for students who change their minds and ultimately do not complete all the Minor requirements (i.e., they are not disqualified from graduating if they do not complete declared minor requirements; they simply do not receive the minor).\n\n\nWhat is Portuguese?\n\n\nPortuguese and Luso-Afro-Brazilian studies is the academic discipline concerned with studying the languages, cultural expressions, and peoples of the Lusophone, or Portuguese-speaking, world. Scholars in this discipline analyze literary and artistic works from Brazil, Portugal, and/or Lusophone Africa, often within a comparative context. This field contextualizes artistic and cultural expressions in terms of history, politics, social practices, and economics. Studies in this field may examine the experiences and expressions within the Lusophone context through the lens of Latin American studies, hemispheric American studies, or Transatlantic studies. Questions of race, gender, and class, the legacies of slavery and colonialism, and the repercussions of dictatorships and civil wars often animate research in this field.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to learn or improve your Portuguese and discover more about countries where Portuguese is spoken.\n\n\nYou are interested in how music, film, literature, and culture intersect with politics, social movements, and historical events.\n\n\nYou want to pursue a career in international business, government, non profits, translation, education, or the arts.",

In recognition of the diverse career opportunities in the modern poultry and game bird industries, the minor is designed to also accommodate students with primary interests in agribusiness management, food science, and wildlife science. Students are required to complete a minimum of 18 credits (9 credits at the 400 level). \nANSC 211\n, \nANSC 311\n, and \nANSC 425\n/\nVBSC 425\n provide a foundation of knowledge pertaining to both avian sciences and the commercial poultry industry, while additional courses selected by the student will allow for further specialization in the foundation animal science disciplines, agribusiness management, food science, and wildlife and fisheries science. In addition, credits from poultry or avian internship experiences and/or independent study projects may also be applied towards meeting the requirements of the minor.\n \nThe University's Poultry Education and Research Center is used extensively for supplementing classroom work with hands-on laboratories. The flexibility of the minor permits program planning commensurate with an individual's interests and professional goals, and should enhance the student's ability to compete for related positions in industry, government, or academia (graduate or professional school).\n\n\nWhat is Poultry and Avian Science?\n\n\nPoultry and Avian Science encompasses avian biology, management, and health. Domestic fowl, or poultry, are birds that are kept primarily for meat and eggs. The history of domestication of chickens and ducks dates back thousands of years to the Chinese, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, while turkeys served as food for Indians in North America as early as 1000 A.D. Chicken has become the world\u2019s preferred meat, and this has occurred because of tremendous scientific advances in breeding (genetics), physiology, nutrition, and management (husbandry). Besides food, poultry can provide fiber (e.g., down and feathers). Today\u2019s modern poultry industry is science-based, technologically advanced, efficient, and environmentally conscious. Animal health and well-being are integral components of overall management strategies. In addition to poultry, opportunities to learn about other avian species through course work and research are possible.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou are passionate about birds and want to learn about avian biology, management, and health.\n\n\nYou like hands-on experiences in both caring for animals and/or conducting independent research projects.\n\n\nYou want to undertake industry internships.\n\n\nYou are interested in intercollegiate poultry judging.\n\n\nYou seek a career in a dynamic growing industry that feeds the world.\n\n\nYou want to pursue post-baccalaureate graduate (research) or professional degrees in avian biology or avian medicine.",

        "program_description": "Program Description\n\n\nThe major in Professional Photography is a professional undergraduate degree in photography designed to provide in-depth, formal education that will prepare students for careers in client-based professional photography or related fields. Students enrolled in the program will acquire practical skills and learn creative techniques relevant to professional photographic image making. The degree program focuses on building and synthesizing career oriented competencies essential to photographers' professional, intellectual, and cultural lives.\n \nThe learning objectives and essential competencies of the Professional Photography major align with NASAD standards for undergraduate professional degrees. NASAD is the professional agency responsible for accrediting Penn State's art and design programs within the College of Arts and Architecture. This B. Des. in Professional Photography also addresses student career success and economic development.\n\n\nWhat is Photography?\n\n\nPhotography involves using image making technologies to take visual samples of the world around us to create responses, representations, and interpretations that cause us to think about what we see, and to question what we know. This creative and critical practice emerges from innumerable motivations that arise from a deep-felt desire for personal expression, or a belief that visual arts and design can influence how we encounter and understand everyday life. Whether exploring and applying photography as a means of responding to personal ideas and issues, or using image making to meet a client\u2019s expectations, the discipline requires a range of specialized knowledge and skills in the use of tools, techniques, technologies, and processes to enable working from a concept to finished photographic forms. Hence, developing your individual visual language as a photographer involves mastery of materials, equipment, and processes, and developing a vision of aesthetic forms, functions, and content relationships.\n\n\nYou Might Like this Program If...\n\n\nYour personal interests and professional aspirations are inspired by the power of photography to reach into our lives to capture the diversity, complexity, and humanity. Virtually all visual information we encounter online and in print media relies on photography to communicate content in visually stimulating and aesthetically pleasing ways. Although photographic images are found in many disciplines, the art of photography remains firmly embedded within the imagination of seeing.\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY",

The program explores a myriad of critical issues facing our communities, the nation, and the world. Students receive the educational foundation for careers in the public sector, in government-related businesses, and in non-profit organizations, as well as for graduate work in the fields of law, public administration, criminal justice, public policy, political science, and health care administration. Building on the program core, students may choose electives from a broad array of courses in public policy and other areas. For-credit Internship opportunities are available, including the Harrisburg Semester program, where qualifying students may apply for a scholarship.\n \nStudents may wish but are not required to pursue a concentration within the Public Policy major. The following concentrations are available:\n \n \nState and Local Government\n \nGovernmental Affairs and Public Service Careers\n \nPolicy Analysis and Governance Studies\n \n \nStudents should consult their adviser for a complete listing of courses in each of these concentrations. Overall, the Public Policy program seeks to advance the ideals of civic culture and a commitment to public service.\n \nOur proximity to the state capital at Harrisburg provides students with a rich environment for both study and for internships. In addition to our full-time faculty, Public Policy draws on part-time faculty with particular professional strengths. In recent years students have explored politics and political issues in classes taught by a state senator, a former lieutenant governor, a corrections system administrator, and a governor's press secretary. This integration of academic study with the \"real world\" of Pennsylvania politics and policy making is further enhanced through quality internships. The Public Policy program prides itself in placing qualified students in internships that facilitate the development of professional skills and promote the prospects for professional employment following graduation.\n \nStudents are encouraged to complete an internship during their senior year. Additional information regarding internships may be obtained by contacting the School of Public Affairs Internship Coordinator (see \nhttps://harrisburg.psu.edu/public-affairs/internships\n). For-credit Internship opportunities are available, including the Harrisburg Semester program, which offers scholarship opportunities to qualifying students.\n\n\nWhat is Public Policy?\n\n\nPublic Policy is a discipline that focuses on the systematic analysis of public policy issues and decision processes. It includes study in the role of economic and political factors in public decision-making and policy formulation, microeconomic analysis of policy issues, resource allocation and decision modeling, and policy advocacy.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou have an interest in fostering positive policy change.\n\n\nYou are concerned about critical issues facing your community or nation.\n\n\nYou would enjoy working with others to solve these critical issues.\n\n\nYou are interested in a career in government or with an NGO or non-profit.",

The major is integrative in nature by crossing traditional business boundaries while offering specific areas of study in enterprise risk management, and real estate. High profile risks are faced by leaders and managers up and down the corporate ladder and require specialized skills, knowledge, and preparation. The Risk Management major prepares students for this along with a chance to study risk from various perspectives by offering specialty courses along with a common pool of risk management courses. This structure assures that the students in the risk management major are equipped with the common tools of risk analysis while at the same time permitting the students to tailor the specifics of their training.\n \nEnterprise Management Option\n \nThe Enterprise Risk Management Option prepares students to identify, quantify and qualify the regulatory, legal, financial and contractual aspects of enterprise risk; the management of such risks; and the application of risk financing techniques to control risk exposures in organizations. Emphasis is also placed on the understanding of the principles and risks underlying complex business contracts.\n \nReal Estate Option\n \nThis option is designed to prepare the student for a wide range of professional opportunities in corporate real estate management, real estate brokerage, appraisal, property management, mortgage lending and banking, development, and governmental service.\n\n\nWhat is Risk Management?\n\n\nOrganizations face a wide array of risks in today's rapidly changing and complex business environment. Operations can be disrupted by a variety of unanticipated factors, ranging from external forces like natural disasters and political risks to internal factors like faulty product design and flawed financial systems. CEOs make risky strategic decisions in an increasingly competitive marketplace where the cost of missteps is high. In recent years, firms have encountered new risks in the form of financial mismanagement, global litigation, and the growing costs of human resources.\n\n\nThe goal of Risk Management is to enhance firm value through the optimal treatment of risk. Corporate interest in enterprise risk management has grown steadily in recent years, fueled in part by regulatory mandates for improved risk management systems. In addition, organizations like Standard & Poor\u2019s, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the New York Stock Exchange now require increased risk management disclosure and assessment in corporate financial statements.\n\n\nRisk Management can often be categorized into four general areas of risk:\n\n\n\n\nHazard Risk: Lawsuits or damage from natural disasters.\n\n\nOperational Risk: Risk resulting from failed systems, poor design, or worker error.\n\n\nFinancial Risk: Excessive operating costs and changes in commodity prices or currencies.\n\n\nStrategic Risk: Corporate gains and losses from changes in consumer demand.\n\n\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT",

The SRA program positions our students to be future leaders to address the current and emerging security and risk challenges that face individuals, organizations and our nation.\n \nSRA majors will choose one of the following options:\n \nIntelligence Analysis and Modeling Option\n \nAvailable at the following campuses: University Park, World Campus\n \nThis option focuses on developing a more thorough knowledge of the strategic and tactical levels of intelligence collection, analysis, and decision-making. This includes examining the foundations of decision analysis, economic theory, statistics, data mining, and knowledge management, as well as the security-specific contexts in which such knowledge is applied.\n \nInformation and Cyber Security Option\n \nAvailable at the following campuses: Altoona, Berks, Harrisburg, University Park, World Campus\n \nThis option includes a set of courses that provides an understanding of the theories, skills, and technologies associated with network security, cyber threat defense, information warfare, and critical infrastructure protection across multiple venues.\n\n\nWhat is Security and Risk Analysis?\n\n\nSecurity and risk analysis is a field that explores the integrated processes conducted to provide decision-makers with the information needed to understand factors that can negatively influence operations and outcomes, and make informed judgments concerning the extent of actions needed to reduce vulnerabilities, protect resources, and optimize investments. Security and risk analysis is a field of practice with two blended concentration areas: 1) security, which seeks to identify, understand, and analyze critical local, national and international security issues, and 2) risk, which includes risk assessment, risk characterization, risk communication, risk management, and the formulation of risk policy. In practice, the issues and processes for conducting of security and risk analytics are neither separate nor sequential. To be effective, the issues of security and risk must be addressed concurrently and synergistically.\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITY AND RISK ANALYSIS\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to protect people, information, and assets from manmade and natural threats.\n\n\nYou want to understand the role of data in protecting individuals, organizations and our nation.\n\n\nYou are mission oriented, a good critical thinker and wish to put your problem-solving skills to work to make the world a safer place.\n\n\nYou want to make informed strategic decisions that help to defend critical infrastructures that supports our daily lives.\n\n\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHY STUDENTS CHOOSE TO STUDY SECURITY AND RISK ANALYSIS",

Students who complete this 15-credit certificate will be trained dialogue facilitators: they will have an understanding of the forces that shape human communication on the interpersonal, societal, and global levels, and they will be able to apply this understanding by leading small group dialogues, applying a unique communication methodology developed by WinC over two decades. WinC is a laboratory for the sociological study of small groups and facilitation techniques that make communication across borders possible. As such, the study of facilitated dialogue that a student undertakes at WinC is truly \"applied sociology\"\u2014because sociological concepts practically intersect with and shape communication technologies. The combination of mindset and skills that a facilitator develops as a result of this fusion of disciplines is what makes impossible conversations possible. While students at WinC are trained in the specific academic context of applied sociology, trained facilitators are necessary in all environments in which human beings conflict and collaborate. As such, the competencies developed through this certificate are relevant across all academic disciplines. This certificate will prepare students to take on key roles in high level decision-making in education, politics, business, or law. They might also use this credential to build a career in areas as varied as Science, Medicine, Organizational Change and Leadership, Social Policy, Business Management, Marketing, Social Work, and Education.",

Graduates have the background to seek employment in a variety of public and private sector jobs, to pursue graduate study in sociology or related areas, or to enter professional schools in social work, law, business, or health fields.\n \nStudents may choose either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree program. The B.A. degree in Sociology is a classic liberal arts degree. The B.S. degree is intended for students with a strong interest in quantitative skills. Students completing the B.S. degree have additional training in mathematics and other social science disciplines.\n \nOpportunities to work as departmental teaching and research assistants are available. Students are encouraged to participate in study abroad and/or internship experiences while enrolled in either the B.A. or B.S. sociology majors.\n \nGraduates of this program have found positions in social research, social service agencies, government and business research and planning offices, other business positions (especially sales and marketing), or have entered graduate school in sociology, social work, policy analysis or law school.\n\n\nWhat is Sociology?\n\n\nSociology is the scientific study of social behavior and human social groups. The topics covered in sociology are as diverse as society itself, from families to gangs, from non-profit organizations to nations. Sociology focuses on the ways that groups and individuals interact, examining how social environments, like neighborhoods, schools, religious organizations, workplaces, and social networks shape individuals' behaviors and create cooperation or conflict. Sociology uses different methods (surveys, interviews, network analysis, observation, social media, censuses, case studies) to make the invisible patterns of the social world visible.\n\n\nSociology especially helps us understand the roots of racial, gender, and class inequality by investigating the ways that social groups control resources, enforce social boundaries, and accept unequal social outcomes.

Administered by a University-wide faculty committee, the program provides an opportunity for students in any academic major to develop key competencies that will be the foundation for their growth as sustainability leaders in their civic and professional endeavors. Students cultivate these sustainability leadership competencies in the context of thematic tracks that allow them to focus on particular topics within sustainability studies. The competencies cut across all thematic tracks so that all students in the minor will develop capabilities in:\n \n \nsystems thinking\n \napplication of sustainability concepts, metrics and analysis\n \nethics\n \nself-knowledge and leadership\n \nchange agency\n \ncollaboration\n \n \nWhile these competencies are developed in the context of a specific thematic track, they are transferrable to numerous settings and problems, and graduates of the Sustainability Leadership program will be able to apply them to ethical, social, business and civic issues that they encounter after leaving the University.\n \nAll students in the minor are required to take the introductory course, \nFoundations of Leadership in Sustainability (\nSUST 200\n)\n. Within each thematic track, students select twelve credits related to the chosen theme in sustainability leadership. These must include three credits of approved leadership coursework (scholarly explorations of leadership concepts related to the chosen theme) and three credits that offer an immersive experience in sustainability (that is, an opportunity to engage, observe and learn in depth about sustainability challenges and solutions related to the student\u2019s chosen theme). The final three credits for each student in the minor is the 400-level Sustainability Leadership Capstone experience. Capstone selection is in consultation with the student\u2019s major adviser, the minor adviser or coordinator, and the course instructor. The capstone coursework must be relevant to the chosen theme, must have an approved capstone project that includes scholarly applied or theoretical research on a current issue in sustainability leadership, and must include a critical synthesis of the student\u2019s minor curriculum and an articulation of its crosscutting themes. \n\n\nDesign for Sustainable Communities Track\n\n\nThis track allows students to investigate sustainability and leadership in community and urban planning; courses focus on both technical design and community development.\n\n\nEducating for Sustainability Track\n\n\nThis track provides students with the opportunity to explore a variety of approaches to sustainability education and leadership in sustainability.\n\n\nHumanistic Understanding of Sustainability Track\n\n\nThrough reading and analysis of significant sustainability-focused texts in philosophy, history, literature, and the social sciences students delve into the evolution and history of thinking on sustainability and leadership in sustainability.\n\n\nSustainability and Food Systems Track\n\n\nStudents in this track learn about the nature of food and sustainable food systems, and about sustainability policy and leadership issues related to food, including food security, sustainable production practices, distribution, and safety.\n\n\nApplicants to the minor present a proposed plan of study for the chosen minor track. The proposed plan of study must be approved by the student\u2019s major faculty adviser and by the minor adviser. Entrants to the minor are required to have declared a major field of study. \n\n\nNew Sustainability Leadership minor tracks will be developed over time, and students are encouraged to consult with the minor coordinator early in their program planning, in order to be aware of upcoming additions to the curriculum. In exceptional cases, and by written approval of the program coordinator and major adviser, students may propose a specialized track of their own design.\n\n\nWhat is Sustainability Leadership?\n\n\nSustainability Leadership competencies cut across disciplines so that all students in the minor will develop capabilities in: systems thinking; application of sustainability concepts, metrics and analysis; ethics; self-knowledge and leadership; change agency; and collaboration. While these competencies are often developed in the context of particular disciplines, they are transferrable to numerous settings and problems. Graduates of the Sustainability Leadership program will be able to apply them to ethical, social, business and civic issues that they encounter after leaving the University.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou care about the state of the world.\n\n\nYou want to first develop expertise in sustainability themes through engaged scholarship experience in and out of the classroom.\n\n\nYou want to apply sustainability expertise to your own creative, innovative, and original capstone sustainability project.\n\n\nYou want to improve your marketability and employability for sustainability-related positions upon graduation.\n\n\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY LEADERSHIP",

Students take a broad range of courses in theatre theory and practice. They gain experience as dramaturgs and assistant directors for the School of Theatre Penn State Centre Stage. Many direct, design, and perform in B.A. projects and productions, and through Penn State's many student theatre and dance groups. We are particularly interested in drawing students to our program who are curious about theatre itself, and who wish to explore it through devising their own performances, writing plays, and directing and producing their own shows. The B.A. is also Penn State's home for dance studies, offering technique classes as well as a range of dance history and theory courses.\n \nStudents who pursue the B.A. in Theatre learn to research, analyze and synthesize information. Majors develop strong oral and written skills and many go on to postgraduate study not only in theatre but also in areas such as law, business and education.\n\n\nWhat is Theatre?\n\n\nTheatre is a collaborative art form; an art form where different disciplines converge to create a sensorial experience much greater than the sum of its parts.

The primary focus is on feminist analyses of women's lives, women's social, cultural, and scientific contributions, and the structure of sex/gender systems. The interdisciplinary and inclusive nature of the field is reflected in a curriculum that includes courses cross-listed with a wide variety of departments, courses that deal with aspects of women's lives throughout history, and courses that recognize the diversities of culture, race, religion, ethnicity, age, disability, and sexual orientation. The Women's Studies minor emphasizes the development of critical and analytical skills, creative approaches to problem solving, and the ability to articulate productive alternatives.\n \nWomen's Studies minors have a definite career advantage, and can be successful in a wide variety of career paths. Some of these include:\n \n \nlegal advocacy\n \ncounseling\n \njournalism\n \npublic relations\n \nmanagement\n \nnonprofit administration\n \nteaching\n \nmedicine\n \npolitics\n \nart\n \n \nIn addition, many alumnae/i are currently studying in professional, law, or graduate schools.\n\n\nWhat is Women's Studies?\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Studies explores the intersection of identity, social power, and privilege. Concerned with how societies \u201cconstruct\u201d inequality and social bias, Women\u2019s Studies analyzes every aspect of our lives through a critical lens, without filtering out impacts of socio-political inequalities, and lived experiences of women and their families. With cross-listed courses in Anthropology, Communications, Government, History, Psychology, Sociology, Women\u2019s Health and more fields, students can approach Women\u2019s Studies from almost any direction. Alongside the U.S. history of women and feminist movement, \u201ctransnational\u201d feminism offers a wider comparative study of: constructions of gender across cultures; the legal and political standing of women and marginalized populations; the nature and impacts of gender-based violence, mass migration, militarization, climate change, food insecurity and other contemporary challenges on the physical, social and political wellbeing of women around the globe.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\n\n\nYou want to translate your curiosities, experiences, passions and interests into actionable and meaningful work.\n\n\nYou seek out inclusive environments, with persons of different backgrounds, cultures, and races to understand their points of view.\n\n\nYou are passionate about gender equity, human rights, and social justice.\n\n\nYou want to explore how gender and sexuality play a role in culture, the arts, literature, health, politics, the sciences, law, and education.\n\n\nYou see yourself as a change agent in this world!",

Completers of the English as a Second Language (ESL) option may qualify for the Pennsylvania Program Specialist: ESL credential if they hold a Pennsylvania teacher certificate.\n \nBilingual Education Teaching Option\n \nAlthough Pennsylvania does not issue a teacher certificate in Bilingual Education, other states do. Thus, completion of this option as well as any tests or requirements stipulated by the pertinent state department of education (other than Pennsylvania) should lead to a teacher certificate in Bilingual Education. In addition to the Common Requirements of the World Languages Education major, candidates select one of the language emphases, i.e., French, German, Latin, Russian, or Spanish, complete the courses associated with that emphasis and also the Common Requirements for all Emphases. Consequently, candidates also become eligible for teacher certification in the language selected as their language emphasis. Further, completers of this B.S. degree and option may also become eligible for the English as a Second Language (ESL) credential by completing six additional credits, i.e., \nAPLNG 410\n or \nAPLNG 484\n, and \nAPLNG 493\n.\n \nCandidates are expected to have taken their choice of language coursework beyond the intermediate level to be eligible for enrollment in \nFR 201\n, or \nGER 201\n, or \nLATIN 400\n, or \nRUS 204\n, or \nSPAN 200\n.

Dr. Youb Kim, Assistant Professor of Education and Applied Linguistics, and Joan Kelly Hall, Professor of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics, are co-directors of the program.\n \nThis option prepares candidates for advanced work in ESL and for the Pennsylvania teacher credential Program Specialist: English as a Second Language (ESL). However, the Pennsylvania Department of Education only issues the Program Specialist: ESL credential to holders of Pennsylvania Instructional I or II certificates. Thus, completers of another World Languages Education Teaching option may first seek the Pennsylvania Instructional certificate in that language and may then add the Program Specialist: ESL credential, subsequently.\n \nFrench Teaching Option\n \nCompletion of this option and pertinent tests required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education lead to the Pennsylvania Instructional I teacher certificate in French. Candidates are expected to have taken French coursework beyond the intermediate level to be eligible for enrollment in \nFR 201\n. In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in French each semester without interruption. Participation in an approved Education Abroad Study Program is required, typically during semester six.\n \nGerman Teaching Option\n \nCompletion of this option and pertinent tests required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education lead to the Pennsylvania Instructional I teacher certificate in German. Candidates are expected to have taken German coursework beyond the intermediate level to be eligible for enrollment in \nGER 201\n. In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in German each semester without interruption. Participation in an approved Education Abroad Study Program is required, typically during semester six.\n \nLatin Teaching Option\n \nCompletion of this option and pertinent tests required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education lead to the Pennsylvania Instructional I teacher certificate in Latin. Candidates are expected to have taken Latin coursework beyond the intermediate level to be eligible for enrollment in \nLATIN 400\n. In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in Latin each semester without interruption.

In general, students are encouraged to take at least one course in Spanish each semester without interruption. Participation in an approved Education Abroad Study Program is required, typically during semester six.\n\n\nWhat is World Languages Education?\n\n\nThe World Languages Education (WLED) major prepares graduates to teach in all grades from Pre-K through 12. Candidates choose from among the following language specializations: French, German, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. Along with studies on campus and in local schools, students in this major typically complete a semester abroad experience to promote proficiency in the language they will teach.\n\n\nYou Might Like This Program If...\n\n\nYou aspire to teach another language, and to help open children\u2019s eyes about languages in diverse cultural contexts.\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT WORLD LANGUAGES (K-12) EDUCATION",
