M AT H 033 Mathematics for Sustainability (3) (G Q) This course is one of several offered by the mathematics department with the goal of helping students from non-technical majors partially satisfy their general education quantification requirement. It is designed to provide an introduction to various mathematical modeling techniques, with an emphasis on examples related to environmental and economic sustainability. The course may be used to fulfill three credits of the G Q requirement for some majors, but it does not serve as a prerequisite for any mathematics courses and should be treated as a terminal course. The course provides students with the mathematical background and quantitative reasoning skills necessary to engage as informed citizens in discussions of sustainability related to climate change, resources, pollution, recycling, economic change, and similar matters of public interest. Students apply these skills through writing projects that require quantitative evidence to support an argument. The mathematical content of the course spans six key areas: \"measuring\" (representing information by numbers, problems of measurement, units, estimation skills); \"flowing\" (building and analyzing stock-flow models, calculations using units of energy and power, dynamic equilibria in stock-flow systems, the energy balance of the earth-sun system and the greenhouse effect); \"connecting\" (networks, the bystander effect, feedbacks in stock-flow models); \"changing\" (out-of-equilibrium stock-flow systems, exponential models, stability of equilibria in stock-flow systems, sensitivity of equilibria to changes in a parameter, tipping points in stock-flow models); \"risking\" (probability, expectation, bayesian inference, risk vs uncertainty; \"deciding\" (discounting, uses and limitations of cost-benefit analysis, introduction to game theory and the tragedy of the commons, market-based mechanisms for pollution abatement, ethical considerations).",

        "description": "Finite math includes topics of mathematics which deal with finite sets. Sets and formal logic are modern concepts created by mathematicians in the mid 19th and early 20th centuries to provide a foundation for mathematical reasoning. Sets and formal logic have lead to profound mathematical discoveries and have helped to create the field of computer science in the 20th century. Today, sets and formal logic are taught as core concepts upon which all mathematics can be built. In this course, students learn the elementary mathematics of logic and sets. Logic is the symbolic, algebraic way of representing and analyzing statements and sentences. While students will get just a brief introduction to logic, the mathematics used in logic are found at the heart of computer programming and in designing electrical circuits. Problems of counting various kinds of sets lead to the study of combinatorics, the art of advanced counting. For example, if a room has twenty chairs and twelve people, in how many ways can these people occupy the chairs? And are you accounting for differences in who sits in particular chairs, or does it only matter whether a chair has a body in it? These kinds of counting problems are the basis for probability. In order to calculate the chance of a particular event occurring you must be able to count all the possible outcomes.M AT H\u00a037is intended for students seeking core knowledge in combinatorics, probability and mathematical logic but not requiring further course work in mathematics. Students entering the class will benefit from having some experience with basic algebra and solving word problems. The course may be used to fulfill three credits of the quantification portion of the general education requirement for some majors, but does not serve as a prerequisite for any mathematics courses and should be treated as a terminal course.

Matrices and linear algebra are now accepted as the single most essential tool need for the solution of these problems. In addition, linear algebra provides students their first introduction to the concept of dimension in an abstract setting where things with 4, 5, or even more dimensions are often encountered. In the simplest situations, many of these problems can be represented as A x = b, where x is our vector of unknowns, A is a matrix, and b is a vector of constants.M AT H\u00a038is intended for students requiring some understanding of the concepts of linear algebra for their major, but not requiring any calculus course work.

The determinant of a matrix is also introduced; it gives a test for invertibility. In the second part of the course the key ideas of eigenvector and eigenvalue are developed. These allow one to analyze a complicated matrix problem into simpler components and appear in many disguises in physical problems. The course also introduces the concept of a vector space, a crucial element in future linear algebra courses.

Basic high school geometry is assumed; axioms are mentioned, but not used to deduce theorems. Approach in development of the Euclidean geometry of the plane and the 3-dimensional space is mostly synthetic with an emphasis on groups of transformations. Linear algebra is invoked to clarify and generalize the results in dimension 2 and 3 to any dimension. It culminates in the last part of the course where six 2-dimensional geometries and their symmetry groups are discussed. This course is a a part of a new \"pre-M AS S\" program (P MA SS)aimed at freshman/sophomore level students, which will operate in steady state in the spring semesters. This course is directly linked with a proposed course Math 313 R, its 1-credit recitation component. It is highly recommended to all mathematics, physics and natural sciences majors who are graduate school bound, and is a great opportunity for all Schreyer Scholars. The following topics will be covered: Euclidean geometry of the plane (distance, isometries, scalar product of vectors, examples of isometries: rotations, reflections, translations, orientation, symmetries of planar figures, review of basic notions of group theory, cyclic and dihedral groups, classification of isometries of Euclidean plane, discrete groups of isometries and crystallographic restrictions. similarity transformations, selected results from classical Euclidean geometry}; Euclidean geometry of the 3-dimensional space and the sphere (distance, isometries, scalar product of vectors, planes and lines in the 3-dimensional space, normal vectors to planes, classification of pairs of lines, isometries with a fixed point: rotations and reflections, orientation, isometries of the sphere, classification of orientation-reversing isometries with a fixed point, finite groups of isometries of the 3-dimensional space, existence of a fixed point, examples: cyclic, dihedral, and groups of symmetries of Platonic solids, classification of isometries without fixed point: translations and screw-motions, intrinsic geometry of the sphere, elliptic plane: a first example of non-Euclidean geometry); Elements of linear algebra and its application to geometry in 2, 3, and n dimension (real and complex vector spaces. linear independence of vectors, basis and dimension, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalizable matrices, classification of matrices in dimension 2: elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic matrices, orthogonal matrices and isometries of the n-dimensional space); Six 2-dimensional geometries (Projective geometry, affine geometry, inversions and conformal geometry, Euclidean geometry revisited, geometry of elliptic plane, hyperbolic geometry).

This level of abstraction is essential since it is in the background of functional analysis, a fundamental tool for modern mathematics and physics. Another motivation for studying analysis in this wider context is that many general results about functions of one or several real variables are more easily grasped at this more abstract level, and, besides, the same methods and techniques are applicable to a wider class of problems, e.g. to the study of function spaces. This approach also brings to high relief some of the fundamental connections between analysis on one hand and (higher) algebra and geometry on the other. This course is a sequel to Math 312 H; it is highly recommended to all mathematics, physics and natural sciences majors who are graduate school bound, and is a great opportunity for all Schreyer Scholars. The following topics will be covered: Metric spaces (topology, convergence, Cauchy sequences and completeness); Maps between metric spaces (continuous maps and homeomorphisms, stronger continuity properties:uniform continuity, Hoelder and Lipschitz continuity, contraction mapping principle, points of discontinuity and the Baire Category Theorem); Compact metric spaces (continuity and compactness, connectedness, total boundedness, coverings and Lebesgue number, perfect metric spaces, characterization of Cantor sets, fractals); Function spaces (spaces of continuous maps, uniform continuity and equicontinuity,Arzela-Ascoli Theorem, uniform approximation by polynomials.

Several basic physical phenomena are considered - including flows, vibrations, and diffusions - and used to derive the relevant equations. The fundamentals of the mathematical theory of partial differential equations are motivated and developed for the students through the systematic exploration of these classic physical systems and their corresponding equations: the Laplace, wave, and heat equations. In addition to treating the physical origins of the equations, this course focuses on solving evolution equations as initial value problems on unbounded domains (the Cauchy problem), and also on solving partial differential equations on bounded domains (boundary value problems). There is not one but many techniques for solving these equations, and the course presents some aspect of the expansion in orthogonal functions (including Fourier series), eigenvalue theory, functional analysis, and the use of separation of variables, Fourier transforms, and Laplace transforms to solve P DEs by converting them to ordinary differential equations. This course currently serves a cross-section of students at the university with interests or the need for this advanced subject mathematics, including students majoring in the engineering program, meteorology, physics, and mathematics.

Projective equivalence, singular points, classification of cubics.M AT H\u00a0437 Algebraic Geometry (3)(B A) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The geometric study of algebraic equations is one of the oldest and deepest parts of mathematics, and it lies at the heart of modern developments in geometry, algebra, number theory and physics. Students completing MA TH\u00a0437will understand many new algebraic and geometric ideas by studying examples of curves defined by equations of degrees 2 and 3 in the plane. Fist come conics (given by equations of degree 2 in two variables). Rigid motions, similarities, and affine transformations give different classifications of them. New ideas then show how to get a conic through any five points and prove Pascal's theorem about six points on a conic. Special cases suggest extension of the usual plane to the projective plane, with \"points at infinity,\" homogeneous coordinates, and projective transformations.The main part of the course turns to equations of degree 3 and their singularities, flex points, tangents, and degeneracies. Several new ideas, both algebraic and analytic, are brought in to prove the existence of complex flex points on singular cubics and then real flex points on nonsingular real cubics. There is then a classification on complex projective cubics by a single parameter and finally a full classification of all real projective cubics.As time permits, relations to further topics are sketched: addition of points on a nonsingular cubic, Mordell's theorem, doubly periodic functions, and Fermat's last theorem.The course is typically taken by mathematics majors.",

The course will systematically explore mathematical ideas and tools used to study the natural world. Particular emphasis will be placed on the process of creating a mathematical model starting from a physical scenario. Typically this process will begin with an experiment either demonstrated in the W. G. Pritchard Lab or performed by the students in class.Once a particular model has been developed, students will use mathematical analysis and experimentation to determine the properties and relevance of the model, and to make predictions. Often the model can be satisfactory; however, many times one also finds new features of the system that are not adequately accounted for in the model, and the process begins again. It is this cycle the course will focus on. For a given phenomenon (e.g., flow of viscous fluid, pendulum motion) several models may be compared and contrasted, and possible simplifications will be discussed.A significant aspect of the course is its laboratory component, in which the students will perform experiments or observe demonstrations. However, the main emphasis will be placed on creating and rigorously analyzing the mathematical aspects of the models. Instead of presenting a finely tuned model for a given phenomenon, this course will try to convey some of the heuristic, intuitive, and mathematical ideas employed in modeling.Examples of physical systems to be considered include: simple and compound pendulum motion, chemical oscillations, water waves, and elastic behavior of polymer solutions.The course is open to a wide range of undergraduate as well as graduate students with majors in mathematics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. The course should be accessible to students with some basic knowledge of mathematical analysis and differential equations. Main topics include: modeling with ordinary differential equations; bifurcation theory and stability; traveling waves in epidemics, chemical reactions, free fluid surfaces, and polymer solutions; fluctuations in nature, stochastic differential equations and chaos.",

        "description": "Propositional logic, first-order predicate logic, axioms and rules of inference, structures, models, definability, completeness, compactness. Logic forms the foundation of all mathematical reasoning. To prove a mathematical theorems, one deduces them step by step from basic principles, called axioms, or from other statements previously deduced. Each step of a proof has to be a logically valid rule, such as, for example, the modus ponens: \"If A holds, and A implies B, then B holds.\" In Math 457, students will learn how concepts such as axiom, theorem, proof, and truth can be formulated as a mathematical theory, that is, logical reasoning will be studied as a mathematical subject. The simplest kind of logical system is propositional logic. Here, the basic components are whole statements which are either true or false, and which can be combined using logical connectives such A ND, O R, or N OT to form new statements. Its simple nature makes propositional logic a good system to introduce many of the basic ideas: syntax and semantics, proof systems, completeness and compactness. However, propositional logic does not capture mathematical reasoning adequately. Therefore, one considers (first-order) predicate logic. Students will learn how formulas are formed according to syntactical rules. They will also study how a mathematical theory is defined as a set of formulas, how a proof is formally defined, and what constitutes a proof system. The syntactical notions above are contrasted with mathematical semantics, which considers structures over which formulas can be interpreted. This way, one can rigorously define whether a formal statement is true in a given mathematical structure, in which case we say the structure is a model of the statement. For example, the integers with addition are a model of the statement \"for every x there exists a y such that x+y =0\". A central goal of mathematical logic is to explore how the syntactical side (formulas, axioms, proof systems) and the semantical side (mathematical structures such as the additive group of integers) interact. Two fundamental results in this regard will be covered: the completeness theorem says that one can prove a statement from a set of axioms if and only if the statement is true in any structure satisfying all axioms. The compactness theorem, in turn, is an important consequence of the completeness theorem. It has profound implications for the existence and construction of mathematical structures. Students who would like to enroll in Math 457 are required to have some knowledge of mathematical proofs as provided in Math 311 W.",

        "description": "The course comprises colloquium style weekly lectures by visitors and by Penn State faculty covering select topics in classical and contemporary mathematics. Some talks will describe math-intense jobs outside of academia and help the students to plan for their future career. The topics of the lectures will be quite advanced, distinguishing it as an honors course. In addition to attending the talks, toward the end of semester, the students will either give a presentation or write an essay on a mathematical topic of their choice or a topic covered in one of the colloquium talks.",

Honors students in Mathematics should register for Math 494 H in one or both of their last two semesters. All Schreyer Scholars are required to complete an undergraduate honors thesis. This work represents the culmination of a student's honors experience. Through the thesis, the student demonstrates a command of relevant scholastic work and a personal contribution to that scholarship. The thesis document should capture the relevant background, methods and techniques, as well as describe the details of the completion of the individual project.",
