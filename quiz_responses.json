    "suggested_major": "Based on the quiz responses, the student shows a strong interest in Computer Science and is comfortable with advanced mathematics such as Calculus and Linear Algebra. They are also interested in programming and software development, particularly in the context of Robotics/AI, and have a desire to explore electives in Data Science and AI.\n\nTaking all of this into account, the most suitable major for this student is:\n\n1. **Computer Science BS**: This major aligns perfectly with the student's interests in programming, software development, and data sciences. It provides a solid foundation in computational methods and applications, which is essential for a career in technology and robotics.\n\nAdditionally, considering the student's interest in pursuing minors or certificates, the following options could complement their major:\n\n- **Data Sciences BS**: This major focuses on developing skills in data management and analysis, which is relevant to the student's interest in AI and data science.\n- **Cybersecurity Computational Foundations Minor**: This minor would provide valuable skills in securing computing systems, which is increasingly important in the field of computer science.\n\nOverall, the recommended major is **Computer Science BS**, with potential minors in **Data Sciences** or **Cybersecurity** to further enhance their skill set."
